          Most of the fossils in our Member Gallery were found in Florida
          creeks and rivers. They're as young as 10,000 years and as old as
          five million years.
          <br><br>
          Florida emerged from the warm Atlantic Ocean about 30 million years
          ago, 35 million years after dinosaurs became extinct. For that
          reason, no one has ever found any dinosaur bones in our state.
          However, ancient mammals and sharks thrived here, including such
          unusual creatures as two-story tall giant ground sloths,
          VW-size armadillos, tiny three-toed horses, humpless camels,
          hornless rhinos, fierce saber-toothed cats, massive mammoths and
          sharks as large as a Greyhound bus.
          <br><br>
          Florida's first people were here to witness--if not participate
          in--the demise of many of these animals some 10,000 to 15,000 years
          ago.
