          <h1>Our Meetings</h1>
          <p>Guests are always welcome to the meetings if you would like see what
            we're all about. Meetings start at 7:00 pm and usually take place the
            first Saturday of the month, unless there is a holiday, then it's on
            the second Saturday of the month.
            Located at the <strong>USF Behavioral Science Room #103</strong>.
            <br><br>
            After the speaker finishes we have a short break. Then we
            draw for door prizes and some raffle items as well. We finish with
            any final announcements.
            <br><br>
            <!-- <strong>
              NOTE: Due to COVID in-person meetings are currently not supported
              at USF. Until further notice, meetings will be held via YouTube
              live stream at 7pm on the day of the scheduled meeting.
              A recording of the meeting can be watched from the club's YouTube
              channel anytime after the live stream ends. <br><br>

            <strong>Upcoming Meetings and Guest Speakers (2022-2023 season):</strong><br>
            NOTE: All meetings are the first Saturday of the month at 7:00 pm
            unless otherwise <i>clearly</i> noted.<br><br>
            <strong>Sept. 10 - Dr. Richard Hulbert, Collection Manager, Vertebrate Paleontology
            Florida Museum of Natural History <br>
            Looking Back & Ahead: 40+ Years as a Florida Paleontologist</strong>
            <br><br>

            Dr. Richard Hulbert will retire from his

            position as vertebrate paleontology

            collections manager at the Florida

            Museum of Natural
            History (FLMNH)
            on September 30,
            2022. In this, his
            last talk to TBFC as
            an employee of the

            FLMNH, Dr. Hulbert will reflect on

            his 41-year association with the museum and the major paleo
            discoveries and technological advances occurring over that period.
            He will also look ahead to greatly increased time in his
            “retirement” to conduct research on Florida

            fossils and discuss his plans for a comprehensive program on the

            Pleistocene Mammals of Florida that will include extensive
            collaboration with amateur and hobbyist fossil collectors across the state.
            <br><br>
            Dr. Richard has been a good friend and liaison for the amateur
            community in Florida. His trusted relationship with the amateur fossil

            hunter has probably done more to advance paleontology in Florida
            than any other initiative. We’ll miss Dr. Richard when he’s retired,

            but I can only imagine we’ll see him around. There’s lots of
            research Dr. Richard has had to put off because of other

            projects at the museum. I’m sure it won’t be long before we start
            hearing about his future studies on tapir, horses and other Florida
            mammals.<br><br>
            <strong>Oct. 1 - CANCELED </strong><br><br>
            <strong>Nov. 5 - Annual Auction </strong><br><br>
            <strong>Dec. 10 - Paleo Talks </strong><br><br>
            Many of you already know about Tech-Talks. If
            you don’t, they’re very popular technical
            talks covering a wide range of technical conepts and ideas:
            From how a technology or
            processes work, to how to perform a specific
            task, to lessons learned in a project. Most are
            short, 10-20 minutes. For us, our December
            meeting will feature Paleo Tech Talks. Three
            short presentation and Q&A sessions on 3
            different topics.<br><br>
            <strong>Jan. 7 - David Letasi, There's a Mastodon in my Sink! </strong><br><br>
            Explore the prehistoric world of elephants and their relatives the
            mastodon. What is their origin? Discover why so

            many of these beasts’ fossil bones are found in our sinkholes,
            ponds and river bottoms. How did they live, what

            were the predators that hunted them and what was their

            relationship to other prehistoric mammals? Did early humans lead
            to many of their species extinction? Dave will

            examine these strange varieties of elephant families, their
            prehistoric habits and range. Can science bring back the
            mastodon and their relatives the mammoth?<br><br>
            David Letasi has been interested in fossils and pre-historic
            times since he was eight years old and thus has had many
            years’ experience searching for fossils all over North
            America and Asia. By age twelve, he had discovered three
            archeological sites that are recorded in the Michigan State
            Archeological Site Survey. In addition to dinosaurs, Letasi
            has studied prehistoric man, ancient world history, and
            archeology.<br><br>
            After serving in the Navy, he decided to travel around the
            United States to collect specimens from well-known fossil
            sites in Wyoming, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Florida, as
            well as Canada and several countries in Asia. After he
            married his wife, Suzanne, in 1972 she began to travel

            with him. In 1976 they moved to Florida where it was possible to
            collect saber-tooth cat fossils, his main field of interest.
            Dave worked for Great Explorations Museum in St Petersburg and

            assumed a number of duties, including designing and curating
            exhibits and later worked at the Museum of Science and Industry

            (MOSI) in Tampa. While at MOSI, he led cave explorations for
            children and adults to the Dames Cave in the Withlacoochee State

            Forest, as well as fossil-collecting trips to mining sites in Polk
            County. Since retiring from MOSI in 2007, he has been active in
            projects with the Historic Hernando Preservation Society.
<br><br>
            His lengthy résumé includes being the lead archaeological project

            coordinator with the Historic Hernando County Preservation Society,
            the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and the Gulf Archaeology Research
            Institute of Gainesville. Some interesting projects he’s

            worked on include searching for the eighteenth-century capital of
            the Seminole Nation and the exploration of the Bayport Civil War
            shipwreck site.<br><br>
            If you have any mammoth or mastodon fossil material, bring it
            along to the January meeting. Dave would sure like to see it and
            so would the rest of us!<br><br>
            <strong>Feb. 4 - Dr. Joshua Slattery, Paleontology and Geology of Alum Bluff: Florida’s Largest Natural Exposure </strong><br><br>
            During February’s lecture, Dr. Joshua
            Slattery will discuss new paleontological

            and geological research being undertaken at Alum Bluff and nearby localities in

            the Florida Panhandle. Alum Bluff is
            largest natural exposure of Neogene and
            Quaternary aged strata in Florida. It is
            also one of the best natural laboratories
            to document and understand the fauna
            and flora of the Neogene in the Gulf

            Coastal Plain due to its highly fossiliferous exposures. Alum Bluff is located

            along the eastern bank of the Apalachicola River in Liberty County and exposes

            an extended stratigraphic record ranging
            from the Miocene to Holocene (i.e., the
            last 18 million years). Although studied

            for over a century, new research at Alum Bluff and other nearby localities by

            Dr. Slattery and colleagues is revealing
            new insights on the formation of shell
            beds, extinction of nautilid cephalopods
            in the Western Atlantic, and the physical

            and biological effects of the mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum and Pliocene

            Warm Interval in Florida.<br><br>
            Dr. Joshua is a longtime member of

            TBFC, a Ben Waller memorial scholarship winner and currently
            serves as a TBFC professional advisor.<br><br>
            <strong>Mar. 4 - Dr. Bob Sinibaldi </strong><br><br>
            Whether you make a “big” find
            or just pick up
            another common
            fossil, there’s a
            process that

            starts with finding the specimen, all the way

            to putting it on
            your shelf for
            display. Or, if
            you’re lucky,
            donating it to a

            museum collection. Many of have perfected the art of finding fossils.
            There’s also a bunch of us, myself included, who have neglected to
            properly clean, repair, preserve and log every find we bring

            home. Dr. Bob will discuss proper discipline with the processing of
            the fossils. His discussion will explain everything from getting
            your specimen out of the ground to the shelf in a safe and ethical
            manner.<br><br>

            Everybody
            knows Dr. Bob,
            at least those of
            you that have
            been to a
            meeting or two.

            A longtime member of TBFC, past

            president, and
            current Board
            member, Dr. Bob
            is certainly active
            in the paleo
            community and a big part of what makes TBFC tick. Did I mention
            he is also an author with four paleo books to his credit? I’ll throw
            a plug in here for the Paleo-Store where you can purchase any, or
            all, of Dr. Bob’s books: Ice Age Florida in Story and Art, What Your
            Fossils Can Tell You: Vertebrate Morphology, Pathology, and
            Cultural Modification, Fossil Diving: In Florida’s Waters or Any
            Other Waters Containing Prehistoric Treasures, and The Handbook of Paleontological Terms.
