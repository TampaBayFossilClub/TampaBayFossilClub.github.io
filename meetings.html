            <strong>Sept. 9 - Luis Torres, Jr., University of Florida <br>
            Saber Toothed Cats, Assassins of the Ice Age</strong>
            <br><br>

            Luis Torres is a born and raised South Florida native, who grew up
to have a strong appreciation for the natural world, for both the

present and the past. It was in this natural world that he discovered some
chalky, fossilized remains of marine invertebrates from

a past age. This discovery led him to pursue his curiosity and develop a love
for all things paleontology, invertebrate or otherwise.

Luis first attended Florida Atlantic University (FAU), where he obtained a
bachelor’s degree in biology. This was followed by working as a docent at the
Palm Beach Museum of Natural History and

as a FAU Lab Technician for a few years while he worked toward a
master’s degree in geological sciences which he finished in the
Summer of 2022. Luis is currently working on earning a PhD in

geological sciences at the University of Florida. His studies of invertebrate
paleontology alongside the Florida Museum of Natural

History are further developing his skills as both a scientist and science
communicator.<br><br>

Saber Toothed Cats, Assassins of the Ice Age - Among the most
recognizable and renowned predators of the post-dinosaur era,
saber-toothed cats are known not only for their long, dagger-like
canine teeth, but for their brutal and unique hunting style that
allowed them to dispatch large prey with an efficiency not seen in
other felines. In Luis’ presentation we will talk about the many

different species of saber-toothed cats, where they evolved, how
they lived, and why we believe that their long, knife-like canines
that allowed them to dominate for millions of years, may have led
to their eventual downfall in the face of a rapidly changing world.
Don’t miss TBFC’s season opener!<br><br>
            <strong>Oct. 7 - Steven R. Manchester, Curator of Paleobotany,
              Florida Museum of Natural History <br> "Why not Walnuts (& their
              relatives over the past 50 million years)"</strong><br><br>
            “Why not Walnuts?”, asks Dr. Steven Manchester. Dr. Steven will be
  revisiting the topic of his PhD dissertation on the fossil history of
  the walnut family from 40+ years ago. Many new fossils have been
  found since then and there are lots of new ways of gleaning information from
  them including by micro-CT scanning.<br><br>

  Dr, Steven’s discussion will address aspects of the history of the
  changing distribution patterns of walnuts, hickory nuts, and their
  close relatives over the past 50 million years or so. So, let’s go nuts,
  don’t miss the October meeting!<br><br>
            <strong>Nov. 4 - Annual Auction </strong><br><br>
            <strong>Dec. 9 - Dr. Sarah Sheffield & Students, USF Geosciences <br> "Paleo Tech Talks"</strong><br><br>
            Many of you already

            know about Tech Talks. If you don’t,

            they’re very popular
            technical
            talks covering a wide
            range of technical
            concepts and ideas.

            For TBFC, our December meeting will feature Paleo Tech Talks.

            Short presentations
            and Q&A sessions on
            different topics.<br><br>

            Ohav Harris: Echinoderm diversity through the Paleozoic Era.<br>
            Elizabeth Altier: Estimating the effect of latitude on echinoderm
            body plans.<br>
            Haley Vantoorenburg, Taylor Rand, Karla Rodriguez, Ohav Harris,
            and Elizabeth Altier: USF Geology and Paleontology Collections: fossil
            preservation and museum organization.<br><br>
            <strong>Jan. 6 - Chris DeLorey, Black Angus Dinosaurs</strong><br><br>
            With a career in Natural History that spans 40 years, Chris Delory
            has had the opportunity to work in the fields of conservation
            education, paleontology, zoology, and public education. Starting his
            career at Busch Gardens working in the zoo, he then transitioned
            into classroom education, then back into the zoo field as Education
            Director at the Brevard Zoo. Throughout all the careers Chris always
            fostered a love of paleontology. Either fossil hunting with
            friends, volunteering at Dinosaur National Monument, running
            dinosaur expeditions out west for guests or playing the “Dr Dino”
            character at zoos around the US and in Europe, paleontology remains
            his favorite. In 2020 Chris decided to pursue his passion for
            paleontology full time, with Dino Lab in Rockledge, Florida and
            Dinosaur Expeditions to Montana and Wyoming.<br><br>

            Chris’ presentation for TBFC centers on the new Morrison Formation
            site in Hyattville, Wyoming on the Paint Rock Black Angus
            Ranch. Chris began working with the landowner in 2019 developing
            a partnership to explore an area of his ranch that had turned up a
            few bones and teeth over the years but nothing of significance.
            Once he had spent some time on the ground exploring the site and
            getting to know the geology, he realized the untapped potential. In
            the presentation Chris will walk through this amazing dinosaur site
            and show the full skeletons that are being found there and see how
            amateurs working with professionals have really made a difference
            to the discoveries.<br><br>
            <strong>Feb. 3 - Luis Torres, Jr., University of Florida <br>Ice Age Giants: Evolutionary History of Mammoths & Elephants
             </strong><br><br>
            Among the most beloved animals alive today, elephants belong to a
            lineage no less charismatic. From mammoths to mastodons, and

            from deinotheres to gomphotheres, fossils of these elephant ancestors
            often represent the centerpiece in many different fossil collections,
            strictly due to their immense size. Members of this order

            were not always so grand in stature, however, for the earliest
            representatives were small enough to comfortably be kept as housepets.

            In Luis’ presentation, he will look into the evolutionary history of
            the order Proboscidea in order to explore the evolutionary presures

            behind the growth of this group from medium-sized, pig-like organisms,
            to the freakishly massive and diverse behemoths that dominated their
            ecosystems. Luis will also discuss their unfortunate

            downfall, and why sometimes being the largest may also make you
            the biggest target for extinction.<br><br>
            If you have any mammoth fossils you’d like to show off, bring them
            along to the February meeting!<br><br>
            <strong>Mar. 2 - Dr. Bruce MacFadden, Curator of Vertebrate Paleontology, Florida Museum of Natural History
              <br> Stories from the Badlands! </strong><br><br>
            Dr. Bruce MacFadden started his career in Flori-
  da, joining the University of Florida faculty in

  1977. Dr. Bruce is the author of several books

  and more than 200

  peer-reviewed professional articles.

  He has been a principal investigator

  on more than 50 external grants, mostly from the National Science

  Foundation, totaling more than $35

  million. A vertebrate paleontologist by training (Cornell and Columbia),
  specializing in fossil mammals, he has been the President of

  both the Paleontological Society and Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.
  Dr. Bruce teaches courses on vertebrate paleontology and

  broader impacts of science on society and has been the major professor
  of two dozen UF graduate students. Dr. Bruce has been a

  friend to the amateur paleontology community and has made dozens of
  trips from Gainesville to Tampa over the 47 years of his time

  in Florida paleontology.<br><br>
  Each year the Florida Museum of Natural History takes students
  and teachers to learn about and hunt Oligocene fossils in the

  Badlands of Nebraska. It’s quite the trip and Dr. Bruce has participated i
  n these adventures for many years. We look forward to

  hearing his stories from the Badlands.<br><br>
            <strong>Apr. 6 - Dr. Bob Sinibaldi <br> Living Your Dream!  </strong><br><br>
            If you’re new to TBFC, prepare yourself for Dr. Bob. If you already
            know Dr. Bob, you know that you can expect to learn a lot from his

            presentations. You also know to expect a lot of humor and anecdotes
            mixed into the good science he presents.

            This presentation will take you through Dr. Bob’s “life story” in
            paleontology. From finding his first fossils on a canoe trip with his
            wife Mary, to authoring several published books on the topic of
            paleontology.<br><br>
            Dr. Bob is an important part of TBFC and how we operate through
            the year, so come out and see him on April 6.
            <strong>May 4 - Guy “Harley” Means, P.G., State Geologist,
            Director of the Florida Geological Survey <br> An Overview of the Florida Geological Survey and Museum</strong><br><br>
            The Florida Geological Survey
