            <strong>Sept. 6 - Patty Moore, President of the Paleo Preserve <br>
            A Brief History of Leisey, the Legend and Legacy</strong>
            <br><br>
            Patty Moore is the President of the Paleontological
            Education Preserve; aka
            Paleo Preserve Fossil Museum. She’s done many

            jobs through the years
            from chemist to zookeeper
            but her children’s interest
            in fossils brought her to
            paleontology. If you’ve
            been around TBFC for a
            minute or some years, you
            probably already know
            Patty. She can be found at most TBFC meetings, sometimes giving
            us updates on the Paleo Preserve, and volunteering at FossilFest
            each year.<br><br>

            If you’ve heard some of the “old timers” talking about hunting
            fossils at the Leisey Shell Pit and wondered what they were talking

            about, come and learn! Patty will share the history of the Leisey
            Shell Pit, its significance in Florida’s fossil history, how it relates to
            the Tampa Bay Fossil Club, and its impact on the Florida Museum of
            Natural History fossil digs.

            <strong>Oct. 4 - Aaron Woodruff<br>Prehistoric World</strong>
            <br><br>
            When dinosaurs disappeared, mammals began to thrive and take

            center stage. Prehistoric World invites readers

            into this fascinating

            chapter of natural history, featuring detailed

            species accounts by
            Aaron Woodruff, who
            manages vertebrate

            paleontology collections at the Florida Museum of Natural History. The book is further

            enriched with vivid artwork by renowned paleoartist Julius
            Csotonyi.<br><br>

            Titled Prehistoric World: Over 1,200 Incredible Mammals and Discoveries from the
            Mesozoic and Cenozoic, the book highlights the

            rise of warm-blooded animals after the dinosaurs’ extinction. Aaron presents
            engaging details about each species, covering their

            diets, habitats, and behaviors, while blending scientific accuracy
            with storytelling.<br><br>
            Well-known Ice Age icons such as mammoths and saber-toothed

            cats are included, but readers will also encounter many lesser-known species
            unearthed in more recent discoveries.<br><br>

            “Bear-dogs are among my favorite ancient predators,” Woodruff

            explained. “Before the great cats evolved, they dominated landscapes across
            the Northern Hemisphere and Africa.”<br><br>

            Prehistoric World also sheds light on ancient mustelids, the ancestors of
            today’s weasels, badgers, and wolverines. Unlike their modern relatives, these
            carnivores could grow as large

            as wolves or jaguars during the Oligocene and Miocene periods, making

            them capable hunters of
            deer- and horse-sized
            prey.<br><br>
            The artwork in Prehistoric
            World will grab people’s
            attention and spark their
            imagination.<br><br>
            Aaron devoted seven
            months to researching and
            writing the book, often
            working nights, weekends,

            and holidays while maintaining his full-time role at

            the museum. He even finished Prehistoric World on his birthday.
            “This is exactly the type of book that ten-year-old me would have
            cherished,” Aaron recalls. As a child, he was captivated by dinosaur
            books, often making his own versions by drawing creatures, writing
            descriptions, and stapling the pages together.<br><br>
            Some species proved challenging to document, since many were

            described centuries ago with minimal context. In these cases, Aaron turned to
            Greek and Latin dictionaries to decode their scientific

            names. He also coined common names when none existed, for

            instance, Miopanthera lorteti became “Lortet’s cat,” and Tremarctos floridanus
            was given the name “Florida spectacled bear.”<br><br>

            “Much of the fossil record comes down to isolated teeth,” Aaron
            says. “If we’re lucky, those teeth are still attached to jaws.” Even
            so, paleontologists can deduce a surprising amount of information,
            such as diet, age, and sometimes sex, from these limited remains.<br><br>
            Aaron says his younger self “would have been ecstatic” to know he
            would one day publish a book on paleontology. Though marketed
            primarily toward children, Prehistoric World is designed to appeal

            to readers of all ages, offering both fresh knowledge about prehistoric mammals
            and a greater respect for the diversity of life, past

            and present.<br><br>
            Come to the October meeting to see Aaron’s presentation and

            learn more about our Prehistoric World! We’ll have plenty of copies of the
            book on hand for purchase and for Aaron to sign.
