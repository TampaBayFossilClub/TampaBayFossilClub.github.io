          <h1>Our Meetings</h1>
          <p>Guests are always welcome to the meetings if you would like see what
            we're all about. Meetings start at 7:00 pm and usually take place the
            first Saturday of the month, unless there is a holiday, then it's on
            the second Saturday of the month.
            Located at the <strong>USF Behavioral Science Room #103</strong>.
            <br><br>
            After the speaker finishes we have a short break. Then we
            draw for door prizes and some raffle items as well. We finish with
            any final announcements.
            <br><br>
            <!-- <strong>
              NOTE: Due to COVID in-person meetings are currently not supported
              at USF. Until further notice, meetings will be held via YouTube
              live stream at 7pm on the day of the scheduled meeting.
              A recording of the meeting can be watched from the club's YouTube
              channel anytime after the live stream ends.

            <strong>Upcoming Meetings and Guest Speakers (2020-2021 season):</strong><br>
            NOTE: All meetings are the first Saturday of the month at 7:00 pm
            unless otherwise <i>clearly</i> noted.<br><br>
            <strong>Sept. 11 - Dr. Jonathon Bloch, Curator of Vertebrate Paleontology, FLMNH <br>
            Paleocene-Eocene Fossils of Wyoming<br>
            We will attempt to live stream the in-person meeting. If the stream is successful, you'll be able to re-watch it here on
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrBzpexLj0k&t=356s&ab_channel=TampaBayFossilClub" class="links"> YouTube </a></strong>
            <br><br>
            Dr. Jonathan Bloch’s research involves the study of fossil mammals
            from the Paleogene (65 to 25 million years ago) in order to address
            paleoecological, phylogenetic, and biogeographic questions surrounding
            the first appearance and early evolution of Primates and

            other mammals of modern aspect.<br><br>
            The origin of primates represents the first
            clear step in the divergence of humans from
            the rest of mammals, yet our understanding

            of this important period in evolutionary history remains limited. A major emphasis is

            the interval from the terminal Cretaceous
            through the early Eocene, which includes
            the evolution and diversification of “archaic”
            mammals following the extinction of the
            dinosaurs and the first appearance of nearly
            one-half of the modern orders of mammals,
            several appearing coincident with rapid,
            large-scale, global warming at the Paleocene
            -Eocene boundary. Primary data supporting

            this research come from active paleontological fieldwork in the
            Paleocene-Eocene of the

            Clarks Fork, Bighorn, and Crazy Mountain
            basins of Wyoming and Montana, and
            northern Colombia (South America).<br><br>

            Dr. Jonathan’s peer-reviewed papers include
            anatomical descriptions and analysis of the

            first primate radiation based on remarkably complete skeletons.
            Using data from high-resolution X-ray CT imaging methods, he has

            revolutionized this field by revealing detailed aspects of the
            anatomy of the skull and evolution of the brain in fossil primates.
            Based on these studies, he has demonstrated that the fossil record of
            Primates is well represented in the Paleocene, effectively extending

            the fossil record of that group by 10 million years beyond what had
            previously been thought.<br><br>

            Dr. Jonathan’s research projects on Paleocene-Eocene mammals
            from Wyoming and Montana have been funded by four grants from

            the National Science Foundation (NSF) since 2003. With this funding,
            he is studying the response of vertebrate and plant
            communities to climate change, as well as the phylogeny, evolutionary
            morphology, and paleoecology of small mammals, especially primates

            and their relatives, using some of the most exquisitely preserved
            mammalian skulls and skeletons yet known for this time interval.

            Dr. Jonathan has also received funding to collect and study late
            Pliocene (4 million years old) mammal fossils from Florida, and another

            to work on early Miocene (20 million years old) fossils from the
            Panama Canal.

            <strong>Oct. 2 - David Letasi - Terror Pigs and Walking Whales!<br>
              We will attempt to live stream the in-person meeting. If the stream is successful, you'll be able to re-watch it here on
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrBzpexLj0k&t=356s&ab_channel=TampaBayFossilClub" class="links"> YouTube </a> </strong>
              <br><br>
              David Letasi has been interested in fossils and pre-historic times

              since he was eight years old and thus has had many years’ experience
              searching for fossils all over North America and Asia. By age

              twelve, he had discovered three archeological sites that are recorded
              in the Michigan State Archeological Site Survey. In addition to

              dinosaurs, Letasi has studied prehistoric man, ancient world history,
              and archeology.<br><br>
              After serving in the Navy, he decided to travel around the United

              States to collect specimens from well-known fossil sites in Wyoming,
              Nebraska, South Dakota, and Florida, as well as Canada and

              several countries in Asia. After he married his wife, Suzanne, in
              1972 she began to travel with him. In 1976 they moved to Florida
              where it was possible to collect saber-tooth cat fossils, his main
              field of interest.<br><br>
              Dave worked for Great Explorations Museum in St Petersburg and

              assumed a number of duties, including designing and curating exhibits
              and later worked at the Museum of Science and Industry

              (MOSI) in Tampa. While at MOSI, he led cave explorations for
              children and adults to the Dames Cave in the Withlacoochee State
              Forest, as well as fossil-collecting trips to mining sites in Polk County.

              Since retiring from MOSI in 2007, he has been active in projects
              with the Historic Hernando Preservation Society.<br><br>
              His lengthy résumé includes being the lead archaeological project

              coordinator with the Historic Hernando County Preservation Society,
              the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and the Gulf Archaeology Research
              Institute of Gainesville. Some interesting projects he’s

              worked on include searching for the eighteenth-century capital of
              the Seminole Nation and the exploration of the Bayport Civil War
              shipwreck site.<br><br>
              Dave’s presentation will discuss “Terror Pigs and Walking Whales",
              the convergent relationship between the Cetacea and primitive

              Artiodactals. This lecture will follow the research and paleontological
              history of the discovery of vertebrate fossils of early whales and

              their cousins the Entelodonts.<br><br>
            <strong>Nov. 6 - TBFC Ben Waller Memorial Auction with Dr. Bob Sinibaldi as auctioneer
            <br>There will be no live stream or recording for the auction.</strong>
              <br><br>
              TBFC’s November meeting will host our annual Ben Waller Memorial
              Scholarship Auction. This will be your best opportunity to pick up

              all sorts of “paleo” related goodies for your favorite fossil hunter.
              Or, what the heck, to keep for yourself! And it’s all for a good
              cause. Proceeds will help benefit the numerous scholarships TBFC
              awards throughout the year.<br><br>
              There will be lots of “paleo” items available in the auction from all
              of the generous folks who donate to this worthy cause. So, if you
              have a bunch of those pesky meg teeth laying around, or too many
              mammoth molars to fit under your bed, consider donating them to
              this excellent cause! If you don’t have any fossils you’re ready to
              part with yet, a big heart and an open wallet is all you need. What
              makes the Ben Waller Memorial Auction a success... is YOU!
              TBFC’s auctioneer extraordinaire will once again be our very own
              Dr. Bob Sinibaldi. His booming voice and silly anecdotes keep the
              auction interesting and a show not to be missed.<br><br>
              Please keep in mind that we haven’t had an auction in a long time.
              We need these funds to operate and pay scholarships to students in
              the geosciences. If you haven’t attended an auction in the past,
              please consider coming to the November meeting. Dr. Bob has
              made the auctions as funny and entertaining as they can be. If you
              attend, I promise you’ll have a good time whether you bid on any
              fossils or not.<br><br>
              We’ll have lots of great paleo-items to auction off including a good
              supply of legally collected artifacts. And... to make it easier for you
              to purchase items from TBFC’s auction and paleo store, we take
              checks, credit and debit cards, and gold doubloon!<br><br>
