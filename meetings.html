            <strong>Sept. 11 - Dr. Jonathon Bloch, Curator of Vertebrate Paleontology, FLMNH <br>
            Paleocene-Eocene Fossils of Wyoming<br>
            We will attempt to live stream the in-person meeting. If the stream is successful, you'll be able to re-watch it here on
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrBzpexLj0k&t=356s&ab_channel=TampaBayFossilClub" class="links"> YouTube </a></strong>
            <br><br>
            Dr. Jonathan Bloch’s research involves the study of fossil mammals
            from the Paleogene (65 to 25 million years ago) in order to address
            paleoecological, phylogenetic, and biogeographic questions surrounding
            the first appearance and early evolution of Primates and

            other mammals of modern aspect.<br><br>
            The origin of primates represents the first
            clear step in the divergence of humans from
            the rest of mammals, yet our understanding

            of this important period in evolutionary history remains limited. A major emphasis is

            the interval from the terminal Cretaceous
            through the early Eocene, which includes
            the evolution and diversification of “archaic”
            mammals following the extinction of the
            dinosaurs and the first appearance of nearly
            one-half of the modern orders of mammals,
            several appearing coincident with rapid,
            large-scale, global warming at the Paleocene
            -Eocene boundary. Primary data supporting

            this research come from active paleontological fieldwork in the
            Paleocene-Eocene of the

            Clarks Fork, Bighorn, and Crazy Mountain
            basins of Wyoming and Montana, and
            northern Colombia (South America).<br><br>

            Dr. Jonathan’s peer-reviewed papers include
            anatomical descriptions and analysis of the

            first primate radiation based on remarkably complete skeletons.
            Using data from high-resolution X-ray CT imaging methods, he has

            revolutionized this field by revealing detailed aspects of the
            anatomy of the skull and evolution of the brain in fossil primates.
            Based on these studies, he has demonstrated that the fossil record of
            Primates is well represented in the Paleocene, effectively extending

            the fossil record of that group by 10 million years beyond what had
            previously been thought.<br><br>

            Dr. Jonathan’s research projects on Paleocene-Eocene mammals
            from Wyoming and Montana have been funded by four grants from

            the National Science Foundation (NSF) since 2003. With this funding,
            he is studying the response of vertebrate and plant
            communities to climate change, as well as the phylogeny, evolutionary
            morphology, and paleoecology of small mammals, especially primates

            and their relatives, using some of the most exquisitely preserved
            mammalian skulls and skeletons yet known for this time interval.

            Dr. Jonathan has also received funding to collect and study late
            Pliocene (4 million years old) mammal fossils from Florida, and another

            to work on early Miocene (20 million years old) fossils from the
            Panama Canal.

            <strong>Oct. 2 - David Letasi - Terror Pigs and Walking Whales!<br>
              We will attempt to live stream the in-person meeting. If the stream is successful, you'll be able to re-watch it here on
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrBzpexLj0k&t=356s&ab_channel=TampaBayFossilClub" class="links"> YouTube </a> </strong>
              <br><br>
              David Letasi has been interested in fossils and pre-historic times

              since he was eight years old and thus has had many years’ experience
              searching for fossils all over North America and Asia. By age

              twelve, he had discovered three archeological sites that are recorded
              in the Michigan State Archeological Site Survey. In addition to

              dinosaurs, Letasi has studied prehistoric man, ancient world history,
              and archeology.<br><br>
              After serving in the Navy, he decided to travel around the United

              States to collect specimens from well-known fossil sites in Wyoming,
              Nebraska, South Dakota, and Florida, as well as Canada and

              several countries in Asia. After he married his wife, Suzanne, in
              1972 she began to travel with him. In 1976 they moved to Florida
              where it was possible to collect saber-tooth cat fossils, his main
              field of interest.<br><br>
              Dave worked for Great Explorations Museum in St Petersburg and

              assumed a number of duties, including designing and curating exhibits
              and later worked at the Museum of Science and Industry

              (MOSI) in Tampa. While at MOSI, he led cave explorations for
              children and adults to the Dames Cave in the Withlacoochee State
              Forest, as well as fossil-collecting trips to mining sites in Polk County.

              Since retiring from MOSI in 2007, he has been active in projects
              with the Historic Hernando Preservation Society.<br><br>
              His lengthy résumé includes being the lead archaeological project

              coordinator with the Historic Hernando County Preservation Society,
              the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and the Gulf Archaeology Research
              Institute of Gainesville. Some interesting projects he’s

              worked on include searching for the eighteenth-century capital of
              the Seminole Nation and the exploration of the Bayport Civil War
              shipwreck site.<br><br>
              Dave’s presentation will discuss “Terror Pigs and Walking Whales",
              the convergent relationship between the Cetacea and primitive

              Artiodactals. This lecture will follow the research and paleontological
              history of the discovery of vertebrate fossils of early whales and

              their cousins the Entelodonts.<br><br>
            <strong>Nov. 6 - TBFC Ben Waller Memorial Auction with Dr. Bob Sinibaldi as auctioneer
            <br>There will be no live stream or recording for the auction.</strong>
              <br><br>
              TBFC’s November meeting will host our annual Ben Waller Memorial
              Scholarship Auction. This will be your best opportunity to pick up

              all sorts of “paleo” related goodies for your favorite fossil hunter.
              Or, what the heck, to keep for yourself! And it’s all for a good
              cause. Proceeds will help benefit the numerous scholarships TBFC
              awards throughout the year.<br><br>
              There will be lots of “paleo” items available in the auction from all
              of the generous folks who donate to this worthy cause. So, if you
              have a bunch of those pesky meg teeth laying around, or too many
              mammoth molars to fit under your bed, consider donating them to
              this excellent cause! If you don’t have any fossils you’re ready to
              part with yet, a big heart and an open wallet is all you need. What
              makes the Ben Waller Memorial Auction a success... is YOU!
              TBFC’s auctioneer extraordinaire will once again be our very own
              Dr. Bob Sinibaldi. His booming voice and silly anecdotes keep the
              auction interesting and a show not to be missed.<br><br>
              Please keep in mind that we haven’t had an auction in a long time.
              We need these funds to operate and pay scholarships to students in
              the geosciences. If you haven’t attended an auction in the past,
              please consider coming to the November meeting. Dr. Bob has
              made the auctions as funny and entertaining as they can be. If you
              attend, I promise you’ll have a good time whether you bid on any
              fossils or not.<br><br>
              We’ll have lots of great paleo-items to auction off including a good
              supply of legally collected artifacts. And... to make it easier for you
              to purchase items from TBFC’s auction and paleo store, we take
              checks, credit and debit cards, and gold doubloon!<br><br>
              <strong>NO MEETING IN DECEMBER</strong><br><br>
            <strong>Jan. 8 (Second Saturday!) - Ice Age Florida: In Story And Art, Dr. Bob Sinibaldi and Artist Hermann Trappman</strong> <br><br>
            TBFC is excited to host the book release event for Ice Age Florida, In
            Story and Art. Dr. Bob Sinibaldi and noted artist Hermann
            Trappman collaborated on the perfect blend of story, and art, for a
            new look at Florida’s Ice Age. Dr. Bob’s presentation will focus on
            aspects of the book and the multiyear long effort to get the book in

            print. <br><br>In a day and age when fewer and fewer books are being
            published, the struggle to get this type of book published may have

            been as arduous as writing and illustrating the book. Join us as we
            celebrate the release of yet another great paleo literary work by Dr.
            Bob and artist Hermann Trappman.<br><br>
            Dr. Bob will have copies of the book available at the meeting at a
            significant price reduction.
            <br><br>
            Ice Age Florida, In Story and Art. Sinibaldi and Trappmenn, 2021.

            <strong>Feb. 5 - The Non-Aquatic Residents of Fossil Lake, Wyoming:
              Joe Branin, Bachelor of Science, Geoscience </strong><br><br>
            The Green River Formation is a well-known and important fossil
            location, most famous for its abundant fossil fish. These fish are
            nearly all perfectly preserved, down to the smallest scale. While
            there have been over one million such perfectly preserved fossils
            uncovered from this formation, far less frequently found are the
            other residents of an ancient Eocene lake system. These include
            birds that inhabited the tropical trees along the edges of the lake,

            and much more uncommon are the terrestrial animals that ventured
            too close to shore and were swept out to their deaths. While

            bird fossils are found occasionally, mammal or terrestrial reptile
            fossils are so exceptionally rare that maybe one specimen will be
            uncovered every decade.
            Since the beginning of excavations in the Green River Formation
            over a century ago, less than 20 of these terrestrial fossils have
            been uncovered, averaging one such animal every 5
            years. Within one year of each other, two such specimens have been

            uncovered: an undescribed pine martin-like mammal, and a nearly

            complete extinct
            tapir ancestor.<br><br>

            This presentation will focus primarily on these most recent finds,

            with never-before-seen excavation and preparation pictures,
            including an overview of the other rare species found in the Fossil

            Lake quarries, how to find them, and how the professionals excavate
            and prepare them once they are found.

            <br><br>
            <strong>Mar. 5 - Fossils in the Schools: Dr. Bruce MacFadden, Florida Museum of Natural History
            </strong><br><br>
            On the UF Faculty since 1977, Dr. MacFadden is currently a
            distinguished professor at the Florida Museum of Natural History (FMNH)

            at the University of Florida in Gainesville. He received his
            bachelor’s degree from Cornell University and his Ph.D. in geology from

            Columbia University, with a specialization in paleontology.<br><br>
            Dr. Bruce has been a mainstay in Florida paleontology going on 50
            years now. He has been involved with most of the initiatives
            prompting Florida paleontology from the fieldwork, all the way over

            to the financing side. Many of the programs, exhibits, and discoveries
            in Florida are due to Dr. Bruce’s continued good work. <br><br>

            He is the author of 200 peer-reviewed scientific articles and 1992

            book on Fossil Horses (Cambridge) and has been principal investigator
            on more than 50 external grants, mostly from the National Science
            Foundation totaling nearly $40 million. In 2009-2010 he was a

            Program Officer in the Education Directorate at NSF and in 2015-

            2016 was a Visiting Scientist at the Santa Cruz County Office of
            Education in California. <br><br>

            Many fossil clubs and societies communicate knowledge and enthusiasm
            about fossils for the benefit of K-12 schools. Over the past

            decade the Florida Museum has undertaken several innovative projects
            that bring fossils and scientists into Florida schools for teaching
            and learning. Dr. Bruce will be discussing these initiatives,
            including the "Scientist in Every Florida School" program. This will

            include a video, PowerPoint presentation, and discussion. And as

            always, Dr. Bruce will bring updates from the museum and collections.
