          <h1>Our Meetings</h1>
          <p>Guests are always welcome to the meetings if you would like see what
            we're all about. Meetings start at 7:00 pm and usually take place the
            first Saturday of the month, unless there is a holiday, then it's on
            the second Saturday of the month.
            Located at the <strong>USF Behavioral Science Room #103</strong>.
            <br><br>
            After the speaker finishes we have a short break. Then we
            draw for door prizes and some raffle items as well. We finish with
            any final announcements.
            <br><br>
            <strong>
              NOTE: Due to COVID in-person meetings are currently not supported
              at USF. Until further notice, meetings will be held via YouTube
              live stream at 7pm on the day of the scheduled meeting.
              A recording of the meeting can be watched from the club's YouTube
              channel anytime after the live stream ends.
            </strong>

            <strong>Sept. 5 - Pete Larson, Black Hills Institute of Geologic
            Research <br>
            YouTube Live Stream: Good Science in Commercial Paleontology</strong><br>
            If you missed this Live Stream you can re-watch it here on
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrBzpexLj0k&t=356s&ab_channel=TampaBayFossilClub" class="links"> YouTube </a>
            <br><br>
            Pete Larson is probably one of the most well know dinosaur hunters
            in North America. No one has found more T. rex than Larson and crew.
            With the release of CNN Films Emmy winning, “Dinosaur 13” and
            appearances on Discovery Channel’s Dinosaur Hunters Pete Larson is
            quite the celebrity.
            Pete is one of the most down to earth people you’re ever going to
            meet. And while many of you are anxious to hear the story of “Sue”,
            Pete has moved on. I’ll tell you now, if you haven’t seen Dinosaur
            13, you need to watch it. You need to know the triumph and
            heartbreak Pete has been through to get to this point in his career
            and research. <br><br> Pete will be discussing good science being conducted
            by commercial paleontologists. Fossils have been discovered and
            sold for almost a 1000 years. From Charles Sternberg to the Black
            Hills Institute, there is good science being collected in commercial
            paleontology. <br><br> This will mark Pete’s third presentation to TBFC, but
            his first through a virtual meeting. I can’t tell you how pleased
            we are to have Pete Larson back for this very special event.

            <strong>Dec. 5 - Dr. Richard Hulbert, Florida Museum of Natural History
            <br>YouTube Live Stream:
            Introducing the Peace River Paleo Project (PRiPP):
            Research, Outreach, and Education</strong><br><br>

            <img src="img/temp/PRiPP.png" class="body-img-sm" ALIGN="left" style="padding: 0px 10px 0px 0px;"/>

            Vertebrate fossils collected from the Peace River and its tributaries
            in Hardee and De Soto Counties were the frequent objects of study
            by professional paleontologists between 1880 and 1928. But since
            then very few scientific publications have used Peace River specimens.
            This change was the result of discovery of Florida fossil vertebrate
            localities that greatly exceeded those then known from the
            Peace River in terms of quality and/or quantity of specimens.
            <br><br>When Florida Museum paleontologists began a systematic program
            of collecting river fossils in the 1960s, they concentrated their
            efforts in northern Florida. But thanks to many generous public
            donations, Peace River specimens in Florida Museum collections
            now exceed 2500, some belonging to species never recorded from
            the region in the scientific literature. Over the next two years, UF
            graduate student Mackenzie Ross and Florida Museum collections
            manager Richard Hulbert will lead a project based on this sample.<br><br>
            In addition to traditional paleontological research, including
            description of specimens and analyses of mammalian teeth to make
            inferences about diet and climate, the PRiPP will provide K-12
            science educators in the region with actual and virtual fossil
            specimens along with data and technical support to develop their own
            course curricula and lesson plans dealing with Peace River
            paleontology. The project will also develop multi-media content aimed at
            avocational and recreational fossil collectors, such as on-line
            identification guides, as well as in-home visits to private collections once
            these can be done safely.

            <strong>Jan. 9 (Second Saturday!) - Chris DeLorey, AKA, Dr. Dino!
              <br>As seen on Dinosaur Hunters! YouTube Live Stream</strong> <br><br>
              Our next meeting will be with guest speaker Chris DeLorey! <br>
              Starts at 7pm on our YouTube Channel! <br><br>
            <strong>Feb. 6 - Nicole Cannarozzi: Environmental Archaeology,<br>
              Collection Manager Florida Museum of Natural History </strong><br>
            <br> <img src="img/temp/NicoleCspeakerFeb2021.png" class="body-img-sm" ALIGN="left" style="padding: 0px 10px 0px 0px;"/>

            Archaeologist and collections assistant Nicole Cannarozzi was
            appointed collections manager of the Florida Museum of Natural
            History’s environmental archaeology program in 2018. She originally
            started at the Florida Museum in 2004 as a faunal analyst after graduating
            from the University of Florida with a bachelor’s degree in anthropology.
            She’s worked with the museum in various positions over the past 14
            years while completing her PhD. “The museum is one of the reasons I’ve stayed in
            Gainesville,” said Cannarozzi, who was hired into her current
            position in March 2018. “I’ve been lucky to work in one of the best
            zooarchaeology labs in the country.” Cannarozzi said she wants to
            focus on outreach, with a goal of recruiting more volunteers and
            participating in museum-sponsored and external events to expose more
            people to environmental archaeology. “I’m very happy, it’s my dream
            job,” Cannarozzi said. “I really like the integrated nature of the
            museum where you have many departments and disciplines under one
            roof. That kind of atmosphere fosters communication and
            collaboration that is so important for our research.”
            <br><br>
            The Florida Museum environmental archaeology program was established
            in 1961. Its researchers use soil and animal and plant remains from
            archaeological sites to better understand past human interactions
            with the natural environment. <br><br> Starts at 7pm on our YouTube Channel!<br><br><br><br><br><br>
