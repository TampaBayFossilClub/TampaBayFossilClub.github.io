            <strong>Sept. 9 - Luis Torres, Jr., University of Florida <br>
            Saber Toothed Cats, Assassins of the Ice Age</strong>
            <br><br>

            Luis Torres is a born and raised South Florida native, who grew up
to have a strong appreciation for the natural world, for both the

present and the past. It was in this natural world that he discovered some
chalky, fossilized remains of marine invertebrates from

a past age. This discovery led him to pursue his curiosity and develop a love
for all things paleontology, invertebrate or otherwise.

Luis first attended Florida Atlantic University (FAU), where he obtained a
bachelor’s degree in biology. This was followed by working as a docent at the
Palm Beach Museum of Natural History and

as a FAU Lab Technician for a few years while he worked toward a
master’s degree in geological sciences which he finished in the
Summer of 2022. Luis is currently working on earning a PhD in

geological sciences at the University of Florida. His studies of invertebrate
paleontology alongside the Florida Museum of Natural

History are further developing his skills as both a scientist and science
communicator.<br><br>

Saber Toothed Cats, Assassins of the Ice Age - Among the most
recognizable and renowned predators of the post-dinosaur era,
saber-toothed cats are known not only for their long, dagger-like
canine teeth, but for their brutal and unique hunting style that
allowed them to dispatch large prey with an efficiency not seen in
other felines. In Luis’ presentation we will talk about the many

different species of saber-toothed cats, where they evolved, how
they lived, and why we believe that their long, knife-like canines
that allowed them to dominate for millions of years, may have led
to their eventual downfall in the face of a rapidly changing world.
Don’t miss TBFC’s season opener!<br><br>
            <strong>Oct. 7 - Steven R. Manchester, Curator of Paleobotany,
              Florida Museum of Natural History <br> "Why not Walnuts (& their
              relatives over the past 50 million years)"</strong><br><br>
            “Why not Walnuts?”, asks Dr. Steven Manchester. Dr. Steven will be
  revisiting the topic of his PhD dissertation on the fossil history of
  the walnut family from 40+ years ago. Many new fossils have been
  found since then and there are lots of new ways of gleaning information from
  them including by micro-CT scanning.<br><br>

  Dr, Steven’s discussion will address aspects of the history of the
  changing distribution patterns of walnuts, hickory nuts, and their
  close relatives over the past 50 million years or so. So, let’s go nuts,
  don’t miss the October meeting!<br><br>

          <h1>View Our Past Virtual and In-Person Meetings</h1>
          <p><strong>COVID-19 had forced us to adapt!</strong><br> Since in-person meetings were not possible during that time, the club
            hosted Virtual Live Meetings on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyGETFOxoPfRrqubfo0JZOA" class="links">YouTube</a> channel.<br>
            Since COVID, we've tried to record in-person meetings and upload them to the site too. Unfortunately not all meetings are able to be recorded but please check the channel for any new content.
            <br><br>Subscribe to the channel to get notifications when we go live or a new video is uploaded!<br><br>
            All our club live streamed or recorded meetings will be saved and can be re-watched anytime! <strong>Not all meetings can be recorded for various reasons</strong>.<br>
