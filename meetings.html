            <strong>Sept. 6 - Patty Moore, President of the Paleo Preserve <br>
            A Brief History of Leisey, the Legend and Legacy</strong>
            <br><br>
            Patty Moore is the President of the Paleontological
            Education Preserve; aka
            Paleo Preserve Fossil Museum. She’s done many

            jobs through the years
            from chemist to zookeeper
            but her children’s interest
            in fossils brought her to
            paleontology. If you’ve
            been around TBFC for a
            minute or some years, you
            probably already know
            Patty. She can be found at most TBFC meetings, sometimes giving
            us updates on the Paleo Preserve, and volunteering at FossilFest
            each year.<br><br>

            If you’ve heard some of the “old timers” talking about hunting
            fossils at the Leisey Shell Pit and wondered what they were talking

            about, come and learn! Patty will share the history of the Leisey
            Shell Pit, its significance in Florida’s fossil history, how it relates to
            the Tampa Bay Fossil Club, and its impact on the Florida Museum of
            Natural History fossil digs.

            <strong>Oct. 4 - Aaron Woodruff<br>Prehistoric World</strong>
            <br><br>
            When dinosaurs disappeared, mammals began to thrive and take

            center stage. Prehistoric World invites readers

            into this fascinating

            chapter of natural history, featuring detailed

            species accounts by
            Aaron Woodruff, who
            manages vertebrate

            paleontology collections at the Florida Museum of Natural History. The book is further

            enriched with vivid artwork by renowned paleoartist Julius
            Csotonyi.<br><br>

            Titled Prehistoric World: Over 1,200 Incredible Mammals and Discoveries from the
            Mesozoic and Cenozoic, the book highlights the

            rise of warm-blooded animals after the dinosaurs’ extinction. Aaron presents
            engaging details about each species, covering their

            diets, habitats, and behaviors, while blending scientific accuracy
            with storytelling.<br><br>
            Well-known Ice Age icons such as mammoths and saber-toothed

            cats are included, but readers will also encounter many lesser-known species
            unearthed in more recent discoveries.<br><br>

            “Bear-dogs are among my favorite ancient predators,” Woodruff

            explained. “Before the great cats evolved, they dominated landscapes across
            the Northern Hemisphere and Africa.”<br><br>

            Prehistoric World also sheds light on ancient mustelids, the ancestors of
            today’s weasels, badgers, and wolverines. Unlike their modern relatives, these
            carnivores could grow as large

            as wolves or jaguars during the Oligocene and Miocene periods, making

            them capable hunters of
            deer- and horse-sized
            prey.<br><br>
            The artwork in Prehistoric
            World will grab people’s
            attention and spark their
            imagination.<br><br>
            Aaron devoted seven
            months to researching and
            writing the book, often
            working nights, weekends,

            and holidays while maintaining his full-time role at

            the museum. He even finished Prehistoric World on his birthday.
            “This is exactly the type of book that ten-year-old me would have
            cherished,” Aaron recalls. As a child, he was captivated by dinosaur
            books, often making his own versions by drawing creatures, writing
            descriptions, and stapling the pages together.<br><br>
            Some species proved challenging to document, since many were

            described centuries ago with minimal context. In these cases, Aaron turned to
            Greek and Latin dictionaries to decode their scientific

            names. He also coined common names when none existed, for

            instance, Miopanthera lorteti became “Lortet’s cat,” and Tremarctos floridanus
            was given the name “Florida spectacled bear.”<br><br>

            “Much of the fossil record comes down to isolated teeth,” Aaron
            says. “If we’re lucky, those teeth are still attached to jaws.” Even
            so, paleontologists can deduce a surprising amount of information,
            such as diet, age, and sometimes sex, from these limited remains.<br><br>
            Aaron says his younger self “would have been ecstatic” to know he
            would one day publish a book on paleontology. Though marketed
            primarily toward children, Prehistoric World is designed to appeal

            to readers of all ages, offering both fresh knowledge about prehistoric mammals
            and a greater respect for the diversity of life, past

            and present.<br><br>
            Come to the October meeting to see Aaron’s presentation and

            learn more about our Prehistoric World! We’ll have plenty of copies of the
            book on hand for purchase and for Aaron to sign.

            <strong>Nov. 8 - Annual Auction </strong><br><br>
            TBFC Scholarship Auction<br><br>

            <strong>Dec. No Meeting</strong><br><br>
            There is no club meeting in the month of December.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Jan. 10 - An Equus Dominated Middle Irvingtonian Site Dr. Bob Sinibaldi and Joseph Branin<br>(or Joe and Dr. Bob Go Diving)<br></strong><br><br>
              About half a million years ago, several horses, sloths, armadillos
              and other animals fell into a sinkhole in Florida’s Big Bend region
              and died. Over time, sediment filled the pit, preserving the animals
              until fossil collectors Dr. Bob Sinibaldi and Joe Branin discovered
              them in 2022 while diving in the Steinhatchee River.<br><br>
              The tannin-filled water makes visibility extremely poor. “It’s like
              diving in coffee,” Dr. Bob explained. After an unproductive day of
              hunting, Joe spotted horse teeth, followed by a hoof core and a

              tapir skull. The discoveries quickly multiplied, many in pristine condition.
              “It wasn’t just quantity, it was quality,” Dr. Bob said.<br><br>

              As the Steinhatchee River slowly shifted course over thousands of
              years, it eventually eroded into the ancient sinkhole, washing fossils

              onto the riverbed. Paleontologists at the Florida Museum of Natural History
              determined the fossils date to the middle Irvingtonian, a

              poorly documented period of the Pleistocene ice ages. Before this
              discovery, only one Florida site had yielded fossils from this time
              period.<br><br>
              “The fossil record everywhere is lacking this interval,” says Rachel

              Narducci of the Florida Museum. The site helps fill a major evolutionary gap,
              particularly for animals that changed size and form

              during this period.<br><br>
              One example is the extinct armadillo-like genus Holmesina. Earlier
              species averaged 150 pounds, while later ones grew to nearly 475
              pounds. Fossils from the site show animals with the larger body
              size but older skeletal features, revealing that size increased before
              bone structure adapted.<br><br>
              Roughly three-quarters of the 552 fossils recovered so far belong to
              early caballine horses. Their abundance suggests the area was once
              open grassland, unlike today’s wooded landscape. The horse fossils
              are unusually complete, allowing scientists to study teeth and diet
              in ways rarely possible.<br><br>
              The site also produced an unusual tapir skull with mixed features.

              While it may represent a new species, researchers say more material is needed.

              Dr. Richard Hulbert emphasized that the discovery highlights the

              importance of collaboration between hobby collectors and scientists.
              Further excavation will be slow due to the underwater conditions, but
              researchers believe many more fossils remain to be uncovered.<br><br>

              Come to the January 10 meeting to see Dr. Bob and Joe’s presenta-
              tion on this Middle Irvingtonian site and to see some of the fossils

              coming out of the location.            <br><br>
