          <h1>Our Meetings</h1>
          <p>Guests are always welcome to the meetings if you would like see what
            we're all about. Meetings start at 7:00 pm and usually take place the
            first Saturday of the month, unless there is a holiday, then it's on
            the second Saturday of the month.
            Located at the <strong>USF Behavioral Science Room #103</strong>.
            <br><br>
            After the speaker finishes we have a short break. Then we
            draw for door prizes and some raffle items as well. We finish with
            any final announcements.
            <br><br>
            <!-- <strong>
              NOTE: Due to COVID in-person meetings are currently not supported
              at USF. Until further notice, meetings will be held via YouTube
              live stream at 7pm on the day of the scheduled meeting.
              A recording of the meeting can be watched from the club's YouTube
              channel anytime after the live stream ends. <br><br>

            <strong>Upcoming Meetings and Guest Speakers (2024-2025 season):</strong><br>
            NOTE: All meetings are the first Saturday of the month at 7:00 pm
            unless otherwise <i>clearly</i> noted.<br><br>
            <strong>Sept. 7 - Dr. Bob Sinibaldi <br>
            Prehistoric Fishing Technologies</strong>
            <br><br>
            If you’ve been around TBFC for more than a minute, you already

    know Dr. Bob. If you’re new to our group, Dr. Bob Sinibaldi routinely
    makes at least one presentation at a monthly meeting per season. He shows
    up to TBFC meetings each month with a presentation in his pocket,
    just in case our scheduled speaker doesn’t show
    up. Dr. Bob MC’s every auction we hold and is a past president of
    TBFC, a current Director, and author of four books on paleontology.

    Because of his status as a “doctor” and his obsession with paleontology
    he’s not even a paleontologist as most folks assume. In another world
    Dr. Bob did God’s work in his career teaching severely
    injured and sometimes terminally ill children.<br><br>
    Dr. Bob specialized in Exceptional Child Education teaching special

    needs children how to play. He made it possible for severely handicapped
    and ill/injured children to get outside and be able to participate in the
    activities and games most children take for granted. Dr.

    Bob has authored many papers and articles on Adaptive Education
    and invented numerous pieces of equipment and gear that allowed
    special needs children to have simple moments of enjoyment on
    the playground. He was also selected as National Teacher of the
    Year in his field.<br><br>
    Dr. Bob has proven himself as an authority in many areas of the
    prehistoric and at the September 7 meeting will make and explain
    comparisons of the Archaic Gulf Coast fishing practices to those of
    the historic Pacific Northwest and the Walmart Fisherman. The
    presentation will take an in-depth look at the similarities of all three

    fishing cultures. Although separated by over a thousand years
    temporaneously, and over 3,000 miles geographically, there are many

    consistent features between these three cultures that continue to
    crop up. So often what today's fishermen believe are new fishing
    techniques have existed for thousands of years through various
    cultures. While the Archaic Gulf Coast cultures disappeared over a
    thousand years ago and left only a spotty archaeological record, the
    indigenous population on the Pacific Northwest coast survived
    through early historic times leaving a fairly complete archaeological
    record. The Walmart fisherman still lives next door to you.<br><br>

            <strong>Oct. 5 - Mitchell Riegler, University of Florida<br><br>
            Snakes from the South and Alligators from the North:
            19 Million Years of Florida's Fossil Reptiles</strong>
            <br><br>
            Mitchell Reigler has been interested in paleontology from a very
            young age. He attended the University of Texas at Austin with one

            goal in mind: to become a professor in paleontology. While in Austin,
            Mitchell developed an interest in the reptile fossil record almost
            immediately, leading him to pursue a Masters’ degree at Virginia Tech.
            Mitchell’s interests expanded while in Virginia to include
            systematic paleo, isotopic geochemistry, and paleoecology. His

            project on lizard response to the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum has led
            him to his current institution, the University of Florida,

            to pursue a PhD. At UF, Mitchell has worked on projects looking at
            fossil porcupines, fossil alligators, and as always, fossil lizards.
            <br><br>
            There are several new species to be discussed, and Mitchell would
            love people to bring anything they have that might be related to his

            presentation! He will be discussing a few “Wanted” fossils that the

            museum desires and is hoping somebody might have already collected and needed
            specimens that can be studied. So, if you have

            any Florida reptile fossils you would like to show off, or share with
            the Florida Museum of Natural History, bring them along.<br><br>
