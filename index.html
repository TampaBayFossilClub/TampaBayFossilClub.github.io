          <h2>2023-2024 Season</h2>
          <br>
          <strong>Tampa Bay Fossil Club</strong><br><br>

          January is here. With that, the river fossil hunting season begins in
earnest. Visibility in the rivers will continue to clear up and water
levels should remain manageable until the summer brings back
daily rains. I’ve seen many of you are already starting to “clean up”
in the river. I don’t know that I’ve ever seen so many river fossils
posted on our Facebook page. Take advantage of this season. You
can’t find fossils sitting on your coach or watching football. Plan a
river trip now!<br><br>

I also must start the new year again by telling you that we are
hopeful to get in all TBFC’s events and activities without some sort
of worldwide virus, hurricanes, or deadly algae bloom. While most
of TBFC’s events have come off without a hitch, we haven’t held a
full-blown Peace River Adventure since 2019. We’re hopeful.
January brings the start of a very busy time of the year for TBFC. In
addition to our regular monthly meetings and field trips, FossilFest
and the Peace River Adventure are right around the corner. We
can run the Adventure blindfolded with one arm tied behind our
backs, but FossilFest, that’s another animal.<br><br>

          please be very cautious while venturing out into the rivers and
          creeks. There’s nothing in those rivers worth dying for.

          <strong>FossilFest 2024:</strong> FossilFest 2024 runs March 16 – 17
          (set up on March 15). The show is big, one of the biggest amateur
          run shows in the country. It takes a lot of volunteers to operate FossilFest and some folks have already started
          working on Fossilfest 2024. <br><br>

          Please put FossilFest
          dates in your calendar and schedule your volunteer time as far in
          advance as you can. We need to know as soon as possible that we
          have the 100+ volunteers it takes to run the show. Please see the
          FossilFest volunteer ads in this edition of the Chronicles.

          all these events with your help.

            With a career in Natural History that spans 40 years, Chris Delory
            has had the opportunity to work in the fields of conservation
            education, paleontology, zoology, and public education. Starting his
            career at Busch Gardens working in the zoo, he then transitioned
            into classroom education, then back into the zoo field as Education
            Director at the Brevard Zoo. Throughout all the careers Chris always
            fostered a love of paleontology. Either fossil hunting with
            friends, volunteering at Dinosaur National Monument, running
            dinosaur expeditions out west for guests or playing the “Dr Dino”
            character at zoos around the US and in Europe, paleontology remains
            his favorite. In 2020 Chris decided to pursue his passion for
            paleontology full time, with Dino Lab in Rockledge, Florida and
            Dinosaur Expeditions to Montana and Wyoming.<br><br>

            Chris’ presentation for TBFC centers on the new Morrison Formation
            site in Hyattville, Wyoming on the Paint Rock Black Angus
            Ranch. Chris began working with the landowner in 2019 developing
            a partnership to explore an area of his ranch that had turned up a
            few bones and teeth over the years but nothing of significance.
            Once he had spent some time on the ground exploring the site and
            getting to know the geology, he realized the untapped potential. In
            the presentation Chris will walk through this amazing dinosaur site
            and show the full skeletons that are being found there and see how
            amateurs working with professionals have really made a difference
            to the discoveries.

        <h2>Tampa Bay Fossil Chronicles</h2><br>

        Hopefully you’ve noticed that TBFC has stepped up its game with
        the newsletter each month. In addition to all of our regular
        contributors, we’ve added two new recurring articles this season. “In
        Touch with Inverts” by Rob Carlson was added in September. Recently added, “Paleo Analysis” by Steve Vicari.
        Each month Steve will be discussing interesting prehistoric fauna and how they
        relate to extant species. <br><br>Please check out all of the articles in each
        issue. <strong>Only TBFC members</strong> receive the Chronicles, we don’t post it online or on Facebook.
