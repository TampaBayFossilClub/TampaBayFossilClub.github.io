          <h1>President's Message</h1>
          <span></span>
          <strong>FossilFest Success!</strong><br><br>

          Well, we did it. Finally. It had been three years
          since we opened the doors to FossilFest pre-COVID back in 2019.
          Like riding a bike though, we all knew what to do and with little
          problems, the show went off flawlessly. I couldn’t be more pleased
          with the results and the people who made it happen.<br><br>
          The return of FossilFest brought in a great crowd. Especially on
          Sunday! The question I get as soon as FossilFest is wrapped up is,

          “How many?” Everyone wants to know how many patrons we hosted for the
          show. Initial estimates show we brought in about 851

          adults on Saturday and 518 on Sunday. That just might be a new
          record for a Sunday at FossilFest.<br><br>
          There are three major goals each year for FossilFest; earn funds to
          operate TBFC through the year, teach the public about Florida’s
          prehistory, and reach out to new members. We accomplished all of

          that! It looks like we had about 30 new families sign up as members
          with TBFC at FossilFest. That in itself is a great success! If

          you’re one of those new members that joined us, I welcome you to
          the Tampa Bay Fossil Club!<br><br>
          Everyone worked very hard, some for three hours, some for three

          days (some for weeks leading up to the show). I hate to thank
          individual volunteers by name in this writing, but I have to mention a

          few people here. TBFC Directors David Faucher and Joe Branin
          spent the night on the FossilFest floor both Friday and Saturday
          night to stand sentry for the show. And both worked the show all
          weekend. All in all, they spent over 50 straight hours at FossilFest.
          <br><br>
          Steve Vicari and Nancy Jacobs have to get the award for furthest
          traveled. They drove over a thousand miles (each way) from Rusk,

          Texas to be with us and volunteer at FossilFest. Both started working
          early in the week helping with the load up and set at Fox 13.
          <br><br>
          I have to thank my wife Seina for working on the volunteer
          assignments for months ahead of the show, and many of the other details

          at Fossilfest that just seem to “happen” because of her. Every year
          for as long as I can remember Barbara Fite has led the negotiations
          with the Fairgrounds and scheduled the vendors. She also handles
          many other problems as they occur. Jerry Zolg spends many hours
          leading up to the show arranging, and rearranging the floor plan to
          fit our needs, and sometimes the last-minute changes that have to
          happen. Our FossilFest trailer is big and weighs in excess of 6 tons.
          We need a huge truck to make that move and for many years Mike

          and Jessica Burnett have driven his “monster truck” from
          Bradenton, Florida to pick up the trailer in Zephyrhills where it is stored on

          the property of TBFC members Darren and Nicole Watts. By the
          time they drive from Bradenton to ZHills, hooks up, drives back to
          the fairgrounds, and then back home, it’s an eight-hour day on the
          road. The Burnett’s do this on Friday, in morning traffic, and then
          again on Sunday. Hidden in all of the excitement of FossilFest is Bill
          Faucher collecting money, making change, and getting money safely

          to the bank. Dr. Bob Sinibaldi assisted me with television appearances
          and also did two presentations each day at FossilFest. Leslie

          Branin and her husband Mike Davis hauled a metric ton of books to

          the show. Fred Hendershot and Joe Dumont spent the entire week-
          end with kids at the Touch Table and Kid’s Mine. We didn’t have a

          standalone Kid’s Mine manager this year, the duties were split
          between about a dozen volunteers. It takes a whole lot of patience

          and dedication to educate and to deal with all of the excitement in
          the kid’s area. A special thank you to those volunteers who sat for

          hours at the Kid’s Mine ID table. Marlin Swikert managed the Silent

          Auction and along with John and Cheryl Jacobs and other volun-
          teers, killed it (that’s a good thing the kids tell me). And that’s just

          some of the many big things that get done at FossilFest.
          <br><br>
          I have to thank all of TBFC’s Officers, Directors, and <strong>ALL of the
          members who volunteered</strong> to make FossilFest the success that it was. We

          certainly couldn’t have done it without you. If you were one of the

          120 plus volunteers during the show, thank you. From the admissions,
          to the silent auction, donations, club sales, kids mine, set up,

          break down, security, and everything in-between, I can’t thank you
          all enough.<br><br>
          I get lots of praises and slaps on the back during FossilFest. I always
          tell everyone what a great support staff that I, and FossilFest, have.
          FossilFest 2022 was a huge success, and that’s because of all of you.
          <br><br>
          So, I have to ask... Are you still tired from FossilFest? Sorry, no time
          to sit down; TBFC’s season isn’t over yet, we’re just getting started!

          <br><br>

          <strong>Peace River Adventure (Sort of)</strong><br><br>
          Even though there won’t be a full blown
          Peace River Adventure this year, there will be field trips in lieu of
          the event. There will be a weekend hunt at Thousand Trails (April
          30 – May 1) a one day walk in hunt and canoe trip at Wauchula
          (April 30). So, there will be plenty of opportunity to hunt as a
          group, we just won’t be doing the dinners, shirts, and auction, etc.
          This will also present the opportunity for our new members fresh

          out of FossilFest to join in on a fossil hunt. With the success of Fos-
          silFest last month, I certainly think we’ll be back to a normal Peace

          River Adventure in 2023. <br><br>

          <strong>Please keep a watch out for any changes that COVID could cause
          with our scheduled events.</strong><br><br> Read the Chronicles each
          month (Members Only), check
          the calendar here on the TBFC website, and follow us on Facebook. Also,
          please be very cautious while venturing out into the rivers and
          creeks. There’s nothing in those rivers worth dying for.
          <br><br>

          </p>
            <p>
              <strong>In closing, I want to again say thank you to everyone who helped out
              this past month. Thank you for making FossilFest, and everything
              else about TBFC, so great.</strong><br><br>
              I look forward to seeing all of the new faces at the April meeting.
              <br><br>
              Good Hunting, <br>

            <!--<img src="img/temp/jan8meeting.png" alt="Art from Dr. Bob's Book"

            The recording will be uploaded to our

             a day or so after the meeting.
            (Note: some speakers may not want to be filmed).
          </strong></span><br><br>

          Growing up in the Poconos of Pennsylvania in the 1970’s and 80’s
          Doug got hooked on fossils at an early age when he was given a
          trilobite fossil and enjoyed school field trips to collect fern fossils
          from the local shale. He read all the books he could on fossils and
          dinosaurs and even dreamed of one day being a paleontologist.<br><br>
          Doug pursued an Astronomy degree at Penn State University from
          1981-1985, but switched to General Science in order to graduate on
          time, and earn a commission in the U.S. Navy. In 1997 Doug began
          SCUBA diving and later retired from the navy in 2005. Having
          settled in the Tampa area with his wife, Cathi, he was still not shark
          tooth diving, yet. But in 2012 Doug made his first Venice shark
          tooth dive. His wife Cathi was certified in 2013 and both are
          hooked on fossil shark teeth. So much so, they purchased a condo
          on the island of Venice, Florida near Golden Beach to dive in pursuit
          of the coveted megalodon teeth and various Ice Age fossils. Doug is
          also a PADI instructor and Master SCUBA Diver.<br><br>
          Doug’s presentation will not only cover his experiences diving for

          shark teeth, but also outline how natural forces shaped and ulti-
          mately created fossil-rich Florida. Doug and I both look forward to

          seeing all of you at the April meeting.

        <strong>Tampa Bay Fossil Chronicles</strong><br><br>

        Hopefully you’ve noticed that TBFC has stepped up its game with
        the newsletter each month. In addition to all of our regular
        contributors, we’ve added two new recurring articles this season. “In
        Touch with Inverts” by Rob Carlson was added in September. Recently added, “Paleo Analysis” by Steve Vicari.
        Each month Steve will be discussing interesting prehistoric fauna and how they
        relate to extant species. <br><br>Please check out all of the articles in each
        issue. <strong>Only TBFC members</strong> receive the Chronicles, we don’t post it online or on Facebook.
