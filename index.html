          <strong>2022-2023 Season Comes to an End, Almost!</strong><br><br>

  It feels like just yesterday that we were busy making plans to start
  TBFC’s season, and just like that, it’s nearly over. We had hoped to
  get things completely back to normal (post COVID), and we almost
  succeeded. FossilFest came off without a hitch (thanks to all of
  you). Hurricane Ian did foil our plans to hold a full-blown Peace
  River Adventure, but, there’s always next season. There are still
  plenty of events left before TBFC takes a much deserved summer
  hiatus. <br><br>If you’re new to TBFC you may not know that we shut
  down for the summer. TBFC will host our end of the season dinner
  on June 10, but there will be no regular monthly meetings held in
  June, July, or August. This will be your last edition of the Chronicles
  (newsletter) for this season, so be sure to check the calendar and
  field trip pages for TBFC’s remaining events.

           <strong>Peace River "Mini" Adventure</strong>.<br><br>
             April 29th 2023<br><br>
             The Peace River Adventure has turned into one of
             TBFC’s most popular outings. Years ago we worried if we’d get enough participation

to make the event even worth the work. Now, we sometimes worry
if we can accommodate everyone who wants to attend. That was
before COVID though, and now the hurricanes during the past year.
We have hoped that we would be able to run the entire weekend
event in 2023. It appears that damage from Hurricane Ian though

will prevent that from happening.
We did run a Mini Adventure last, but it wasn’t well received.

With FossilFest comes many new members, some who have

never set foot into a river or mine in search of fossilized creatures from the past. The Peace River trip has become these

folk’s freshman outing in paleontology and the perfect opportunity to learn how to hunt for their very own fossils. The trip

has also become a sort of reunion for many of us who have
attended the event for decades.
Even though we have had in excess of 300 people show up for

the Peace River Adventure’s weekend event, when we downsized to a single day of hunting because of COVID there was

little participation. And I mean “little”. I guess without the
camping, BBQ, auction and Dr. Bob’s famous campfire pie

night, we just aren’t
going to get as many
people to come out.
Despite that, we will

press forward to provide an advertised day

of hunting for our
new members that
we picked up during
FossilFest. These
folks will be biting at
the bit to get out and
hunt some fossils and
we will be ready for
them.
<br><br>
The Peace River Adventure is a wonderful family outing and

the only TBFC fieldtrip

when we invite non-members to join in on

the hunt. This is your

opportunity to introduce friends and fam-
ily to TBFC and Florida’s prehistoric past.

The river is at its shallowest level and accessible by hunters of

all ages (when Mother
Nature cooperates).<br><br>
We will be doing both
a walk-in screening and a canoe trip on April 29, both starting at
9AM. Screeners should meet at <strong>Peace River Park 1322 E. Main St.,
Wauchula</strong>. For canoe and kayak, meet at <strong>100 Park Drive (north East
Main Street bridge) Wauchula, Florida 33873</strong>.

<h2>UPDATE: The Peace River "Mini" Adventure folks that are only sifting (not kayaking) will meet at Gardener Boat Ramp because the Peace River Park is still closed. </h2>
Gardener Boat Ramp Address:<strong> 547 River Rd SW, Zolfo Springs, FL 33890 </strong> Canoe and kayaker's meet at the Wauchula Boat Ramp (Main Street Bridge) 9AM is still the start time for both locations. 
             <br><br>

          <!--<strong>Please keep a watch out for any changes that COVID could cause
          with our scheduled events.</strong><br><br>--> Read the Chronicles each
          month (Members Only), check
          the calendar here on the TBFC website, and follow us on Facebook. Also,
          please be very cautious while venturing out into the rivers and
          creeks. There’s nothing in those rivers worth dying for.

          <br><br>

          <strong>Closed for Summer</strong><br><br>

Our season comes to an end. As I have reported to

you many times in the past, it is an honor and a privilege to serve

and represent the Tampa Bay Fossil Club and its many fine members.<br><br>

I want to thank the great support staff behind me in the Officers,
Directors, and many of you members who volunteer to help TBFC
excel to the exceptional level it has in both the public and scientific
communities. Without all of you, none of what TBFC accomplishes
each season would be possible.<br><br>
Thanks for the adventure TBFC!

        <h2>Tampa Bay Fossil Chronicles</h2><br>

        Hopefully you’ve noticed that TBFC has stepped up its game with
        the newsletter each month. In addition to all of our regular
        contributors, we’ve added two new recurring articles this season. “In
        Touch with Inverts” by Rob Carlson was added in September. Recently added, “Paleo Analysis” by Steve Vicari.
        Each month Steve will be discussing interesting prehistoric fauna and how they
        relate to extant species. <br><br>Please check out all of the articles in each
        issue. <strong>Only TBFC members</strong> receive the Chronicles, we don’t post it online or on Facebook.
