          Our season has come to an end. As I have reported to you
          many times in the past, it is an honor and a privilege to serve and
          represent the Tampa Bay Fossil Club and its many fine members.
          I want to thank the great support staff behind me in the Officers,
          Directors, and many of you members who volunteer to help TBFC
          excel to the exceptional level it has in both the public and scientific
          communities. Without all of you, none of what TBFC accomplishes

          The Florida Geological Survey
          (FGS), located in Tallahassee,
          Florida, was established in
          1907. Since then, the FGS has
          worked tirelessly to execute

          their mission which is to collect, interpret, maintain, and

          distribute geologic information
          to benefit Florida. Today, the
          FGS is a Division within the
          Regulatory Programs of the

          Florida Department of Environmental Protection. The

          FGS currently has 33 full time

          employees, as well as a number of OPS and interns, organized into
          five sections. Harley’s talk will provide attendees with an overview
          of the FGS including its history, ongoing projects and resources that
          are available to our customers. Many of our resources

          are of interest to the fossil collecting community including geologic
          maps, paleontological reports, and our newly renovated Walter
          Schmidt Museum of Florida Geology.<br><br>

          Guy (“Harley”) Means is the State Geologist and Director of the
          Florida Department of Environmental Protection’s Division of the
          Florida Geological Survey. He earned both his Bachelor and Master
          of Science degrees in geology from Florida State University and is a
          licensed Florida Professional Geologist. During his 25-year career
          with the FGS, Means has served as a board member or delegate for

          multiple organizations including the Southeastern Geological Society,
          Gulf Coast Association of Geological Societies, and Florida
          Paleontological Society and currently serves on the Florida Board of

          Professional Geologists. He has also served on multiple graduate
          student committees and is a courtesy assistant scholar scientist at

          Florida State University. He has given more than one hundred invited
          lectures and presentations on a broad range of geologic topics

          and has authored more than 70 publications and abstracts. We
          look forward to meeting with Harley at Mays TBFC meeting.

        <h2>Tampa Bay Fossil Chronicles</h2><br>

        Hopefully you’ve noticed that TBFC has stepped up its game with
        the newsletter each month. In addition to all of our regular
        contributors, we’ve added two new recurring articles this season. “In
        Touch with Inverts” by Rob Carlson was added in September. Recently added, “Paleo Analysis” by Steve Vicari.
        Each month Steve will be discussing interesting prehistoric fauna and how they
        relate to extant species. <br><br>Please check out all of the articles in each
        issue. <strong>Only TBFC members</strong> receive the Chronicles, we don’t post it online or on Facebook.
