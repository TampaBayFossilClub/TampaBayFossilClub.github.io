          <h1>President's Message</h1>
          <span></span>
          <strong>2021-2022 Season is almost at an End!</strong><br><br>

          It feels like just yesterday that we were busy making plans to start
          TBFC’s season, and just like that, it’s nearly over. We had hoped to
          get things back a little closer to normal, and I think we succeeded.
          FossilFest came off without a hitch (thanks to all of you). We have

          field trips up and running and have had a complete season of
          in-person meetings. We are beginning to wrap things up, but there

          are still plenty of events left before TBFC takes a much deserved
          summer hiatus. If you’re new to TBFC, you may not know that we
          shut down for the summer. TBFC will host our end of the season
          dinner on June 4, but there will be no regular monthly meetings
          held in June, July, or August. That doesn’t mean we’re finished
          though. Be sure to check the calendar and field trip pages
          as there are still a few TBFC events remaining. <br><br>

          <strong>June 4 - TBFC’s End of the Season Dinner</strong>
          <br><br>

          Don’t let the “banquet” thing impress you too much. It’s just a fancy
          word for TBFC’s annual, end of the season, informal dinner, and

          get together (with a scholarship presentation, fossil auction, and
          some door prizes thrown in for good measure). It doesn’t matter if

          you’ve been a member of TBFC for ten years or ten minutes, everyone’s
          invited. The dinner is a great opportunity for fossil friends old

          and new to get together for a final evening of fun and fossil tales as
          we wrap up the 2021-2022 season. And there’s always a bunch of
          great fossils and “paleo” related items in the auction (if you have
          anything you’d like to donate, just bring it along to the dinner). This
          is a great event for the entire family and cheap too.
          We’ll cater in spaghetti, pizza, wings, salads, dessert and drinks.

          The cost is just $7 per person which makes for an inexpensive
          family outing.
          <br><br>
          TBFC’s End of the Season Banquet will be held at <strong>6PM </strong>
          on <strong>June 4</strong> at the:<br><br> <strong>American
          Postal Workers Union Hall,<br> 4409 West Alva Street,<br> Tampa, Florida

          33614</strong><br><br> This location is about a mile from Raymond
          James Stadium.<br><br>

          RSVP is not required, just show up and pay at the door.
          Don’t miss it! This really, really, is the last event of the
          season, whew!

           <br><br>

          <strong>Please keep a watch out for any changes that COVID could cause
          with our scheduled events.</strong><br><br> Read the Chronicles each
          month (Members Only), check
          the calendar here on the TBFC website, and follow us on Facebook. Also,
          please be very cautious while venturing out into the rivers and
          creeks. There’s nothing in those rivers worth dying for.
          <br><br>

              <strong>Closed for Summer</strong><br><br>

              As I have reported to you many times in the past, it is an honor
              and a privilege to serve and represent the Tampa Bay Fossil Club a
              nd its many fine members.
              <br><br>
              I want to thank the great support staff behind me in the Officers,
              Directors, and many of you members who volunteer to help TBFC
              excel to the exceptional level it has in both the public and scientific
              communities. Without all of you, none of what TBFC accomplishes
              each season would be possible. <br><br>
              Thanks for the adventure TBFC!

          Dr. Joshua is also a long time member of TBFC and participates
          regularly in club meetings and events. He also serves officially as a

          TBFC Paleo Advisor. Raised in Wyoming, Dr. Joshua took special
          interest in marine inverts at an early age. If you talk to Dr. Joshua,

          you’ll quickly realize that his favorite critter, by far, is the ammonite.
          <br><br>
          Ammonite
          cephalopods
          are among the
          most diverse,
          abundant and

          iconic invertebrates of the

          Mesozoic.
          They have been
          extensively

          studied by scientist and are sought after by collectors for
          their beauty as well as diversity. Due to their

          rapid evolutionary rates,ammonite species typically exhibit short temporal ranges, making them useful

          index fossils for biostratigraphy and correlation of strata. Yet de-
          spite extensive knowledge of their biostratigraphy and biogeogra-
          phy, relatively little is known about the ecology of this important

          clade. The Goal of Dr. Joshua’s will be to examine what ecological
          role ammonites played in the Late Cretaceous marine ecosystems
          of North America. In addition the presentation will examine the
          impact that their mass extinction had on marine ecosystems and
          how their loss opened ecological niches that possibly resulted in the
          Cenozoic diversification of bony fish.
          <br><br>
          Don’t miss Dr. Joshua at the May 7 meeting!

        <strong>Tampa Bay Fossil Chronicles</strong><br><br>

        Hopefully you’ve noticed that TBFC has stepped up its game with
        the newsletter each month. In addition to all of our regular
        contributors, we’ve added two new recurring articles this season. “In
        Touch with Inverts” by Rob Carlson was added in September. Recently added, “Paleo Analysis” by Steve Vicari.
        Each month Steve will be discussing interesting prehistoric fauna and how they
        relate to extant species. <br><br>Please check out all of the articles in each
        issue. <strong>Only TBFC members</strong> receive the Chronicles, we don’t post it online or on Facebook.
