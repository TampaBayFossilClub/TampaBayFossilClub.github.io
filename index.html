          <strong>TBFC – 2020-2021 Season Begins!</strong><br>
            <p>TBFC’s return from our summer break has always been an exciting
            time. I don’t have to explain to any of you though how COVID-19 has
            thrown our country for a loop and disrupted a lot of our social
            activities. For the immediate future, things will be different for TBFC.
            Staying out of the politics of COVID, I can tell you that TBFC will act
            responsible and safely until some reasonable type of “all clear” has
            been sounded. <br><br>
            The University of South Florida (USF) has canceled all non academic
            activities through December 2020. With USF being our monthly
            home, we are looking at other possibilities for our meetings. In the
            immediate future we will begin with a virtual meeting. My hope is
            that as evening temperatures drop and rain chances lesson, we may
            be able to schedule an outdoor meeting possibly in October.
            Please support TBFC during these trying times. Log on for the virtual
            meetings. Keep your membership up to date. Look for t-shirt and
            other sales items on our Facebook page. AND, look forward to
            continuing field trips to the Peace River where we can safely distance
            ourselves from each other and still hunt for fossils as a group.
            With your support, TBFC will survive COVID. We will not succumb to
            the “Ill, Kill, Chill” theory of extinction.<br><br>
            <strong>Saying goodbye to friends…</strong><br>
            As we begin this 34th season of TBFC, I am saddened to report to you
            the loss of some of our friends. From nearly the beginning of TBFC
            Helen Cozzini was a staple at meetings, fieldtrips and events. Many
            of you new members may not remember Helen as she packed up her
            husband and followed her dream of retiring to the Badlands of
            Nebraska back in 1993 (fulltime in 2004). We lost Jan Hendershot
            during our break too. Jan was the wife of Field Trip Co-director Fred
            Hendershot. Jan regularly attended TBFC events and sold her handmade
            jewelry at FossilFest and other shows. Jan did not succumb to
            COVID, but her isolation because of the virus made her passing
            horribly difficult for Fred and their daughter Karissa. Jim Ranson,
            who was one of the first amateur hunters to start finding fossils at the
            Leisey Shell Pit, passed in late spring. And last but not least, TBFC member
            Earnest Marshall left this world as well. My thoughts and prayers go
            out to all of these fine people and to their families.
            In honor of Helen, Jan, Jim, and Earnest, here we go…</p>

            <p>
            On a personal note, I’d like to say a few more words about Helen
            Cozzini. My wife Seina and I remained close friends with Helen over the
            years. During our annual travels to the Badlands we spent time with
            Helen both socially, and in the field. Thirty years my senior, Helen
            never had any problems keeping up with our group while hunting for
            fossils. She could climb through the Badlands as good as anyone I’ve
            seen and she was an excellent fossil hunter. It was not unusual to see
            her walk through an area that others had already hunted and find an
            excellent fossil. She was patient, thorough, and skilled in the field.
            She taught both Seina and I how to hunt for fossils in the Badlands. I
            have often said to myself when rushing or cutting corners while
            digging or jacketing a specimen, “this isn’t how Helen would do it”.
            Her love for the Nebraska town she migrated to and its people was
            endless. I will miss her often and think of Helen each time I step
            into the Badlands. Rest in peace sweet lady.<br><br>
            Good hunting! <br>

          <strong>TBFC Returns!</strong>
          <p>Welcome back fossil hunters, it’s that time of year again! The kids
          are back to school (maybe), the dog days of summer will hopefully
          come to an end (maybe not until October), and it’s time to wake the
          Tampa Bay Fossil Club from its summer hibernation! As usual, your
          TBFC Officers and Directors have already been hard at work preparing
          for you another great season of interesting meetings, informative
          lectures, and field trip adventures, COVID allowing! Are you ready?

            Sept. 5, 2020 <br>
            Pete Larson, Black Hills Institute of Geologic Research <br>
            Good Science in Commercial Paleontology <br>
            7PM VIRTUAL MEETING on
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/tampabayfossilclub" class="links">YouTube</a>
          </strong></span>
          <p>
            Pete Larson is probably one of the most well know dinosaur hunters
            in North America. No one has found more T. rex than Larson. With
            the release of CNN Films Emmy winning, “Dinosaur 13” and appearances
            on Discovery Channel’s Dinosaur Hunters Pete Larson is quite
            the celebrity. <br><br>
            Pete is one of the most down to earth people you’re ever going to
            meet. And while many of you are anxious to hear the story of “Sue”,
            Pete has moved on. I’ll tell you now, if you haven’t seen Dinosaur 13,
            you need to watch it. You need to know the triumph and heartbreak
            Pete has been through to get to this point in his career and research.
            Pete will be discussing good science being conducted by commercial
            paleontologists. Fossils have been discovered and sold for almost a
            1000 years. From Charles Sternberg to the Black Hills Institute, there
            is good science being collected in commercial paleontology. <br><br>
            This will mark Pete’s third presentation to TBFC, but his first through
            a virtual meeting. I can’t tell you how pleased we are to have Pete
            Larson back for this very special event.
