          <h2>2024-2025 Season</h2>
          <br>
          <strong>2024-2025 Comes to an End, Almost!</strong>

          <br><br>
It feels like just yesterday that we were busy making plans to start TBFC’s
season, and just like that, it’s nearly over. The season has run through 9
months without any problems and FossilFest came off without a hitch
(thanks to all of you). There are still plenty of events left before
TBFC takes a much deserved summer hiatus.
<br><br>
If you’re new to TBFC you may not
know that we shut down for the summer. TBFC will host our end of the season
dinner on June 7, but there will be no regular monthly meetings held in June,
July, or August. May is the last edition of the Chronicles for this
season, so be sure to check the calendar and field trip pages for TBFC’s remaining events until we start back up in September!

          <!--<strong>Please keep a watch out for any changes that COVID could cause
          with our scheduled events.</strong><br><br>-->

          Read the Chronicles each
          month (Members Only), check
          the calendar here on the TBFC website, and follow us on Facebook. Also,
          please be very cautious while venturing out into the rivers and
          creeks. There’s nothing in those rivers worth dying for.<br><br>

          <!--<br>
          <strong><a href="fossilfest.html" class="links">FossilFest 2025</a>:</strong> FossilFest 2025 runs March 15 - 16
          (set up on March 14). The show is big, one of the biggest amateur
          run shows in the country. It takes a lot of great vendors and a lot of great volunteers to operate FossilFest! <br><br>

          The next few months
          are going to be busy
          TBFC! I look forward
          to seeing all of you at
          the March meeting
          and working with you
          at FossilFest.

        <strong>June 7 - TBFC’s End of the Season Dinner</strong>
TBFC’s annual, end of the season, informal dinner and get together is coming
in June! (With a scholar-ship presentation, fossil auction, and some door prizes
thrown in for good measure.) It doesn’t matter if you’ve been a member of TBFC
for ten years or ten minutes, everyone’s invited. The dinner is a great
opportunity for fossil friends, old and new, to get together for a final
evening of fun and fossil tales as we wrap up the 2024-2025 season.
And there’s always a bunch of great fossils and “paleo” related items in the
auction (if you have anything you’d like to donate, just bring it along to the
dinner). This is a great event for the entire family and cheap too.<br><br>
We’ll cater spaghetti, pizza, wings, salads, dessert and drinks. The cost is
just $8 per person which makes for an inexpensive family outing.<br><br>
TBFC’s End of the Season Dinner will be held at the <strong>American Postal Workers
Union Hall, 4409 West Alva Street, Tampa Florida 33614 at 6PM on June 7.</strong> This
is a central location in Tampa, about a mile from Raymond James Stadium.<br><br>
RSVP is not required, just show up and pay at the door. But… If you do know in
advance that you will be attending, please click on the “Going” button on the
Facebook event. This
will help a lot with knowing how much food to have on hand when everyone arrives.
Don’t miss it! This really, really, is the last event of the season!<br><br>
Don’t give up on paleo for the summer though. Stay connected with many of our
fossil friends on our Facebook page. As long as the water remains safe there
will be lots of folks screenwashing, SCUBA diving, and canoeing the banks of
beaches, bays, rivers and creeks looking for fossils. Most of these folks posting
about their adventures on Facebook would be glad to take you along. Just ask!<br><br>
As I close this edition of the Tampa Bay Fossil Chronicles, our season comes
to an end for this publication. As I have reported to you many times in the past,
it is an honor and a privilege to serve and represent the Tampa Bay Fossil Club and its many fine members.<br><br>
I want to thank the great support staff behind me in the Officers, Directors,
and many of you members who volunteer to help TBFC excel to the exceptional level
it has in both the public and scientific communities. Without all of you, none of
what TBFC accomplishes each season would be possible.<br><br>
Thanks for the adventure TBFC! <br>Michael Searle<br> President 2001- Present <br><br>

              Good Hunting, <br>

            <br>

          </strong></span><br>
          <p>
If you’ve been around TBFC for much more than a minute, you al-ready know Dr. Bob Sinibaldi.
A longtime member of TBFC, past president, and a current director, Dr. Bob is
certainly active in the paleo community. And he’s a big part of what makes TBFC tick.
Did I mention he’s the author of four books on paleontology? (Fossil Diving:
IN Florida’s Waters or Any Other Waters Containing Prehistoric Treasures,
The Handbook of Paleontological Terms, What Your Fossils Can Tell:
Vertebrate Morphology, Pathology, and Cultural Modification, and Ice Age Florida: In Story and Art.)<br><br>
Dr. Bob could “take us to school” with any of the chapters from his book What
Your Fossils Can Tell, and that’s just what he is going to do for TBFC’s
May 3 meeting. Dr. Bob’s presentation will cover everything that happens to an
animal from the last breath it takes on this Earth, then on its way to becoming
a fossil, and finally putting that specimen on your display shelf.
Many amateurs overlook the field of taphonomy. Dr. Bob’s overview of this subject
will help fill in many important details about how fossils from vertebrate fauna are formed.
This meeting is not at USF. Meeting will be held at the
<strong>American Postal Workers Union Hall, 4409 West Alva St., Tampa, FL 33614.</strong>
