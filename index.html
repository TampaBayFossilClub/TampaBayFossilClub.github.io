          <strong>TBFC – 2020-2021 Season Continues!</strong><br>
            <p>Getting by. I guess that’s what we’re doing right now.
            Just like everybody and everything else, TBFC is figuring out a way to get by.
            And we’re doing a good job under the circumstances.<br><br>
            Thanks to Eileen Durkin (with her I.T. and virtual meeting skills) we
            have had successful meetings with speakers from all over the country.
            In November TBFC held an online auction. Of course we all
            missed Dr. Bob’s shenanigans as auctioneer, but the online auction
            was very successful (many thanks to those who participated).
            Technically, some of our field trips (Peace River day trip)
            have started back up. Unfortunately, as soon as TBFC’s Fieldtrip Co-Director,
            Fred Hendershot, announced TBFC’s first outing since March, a late
            season hurricane flooded the Peace River. After the holidays
            though, TBFC will start up day trips to the Peace River.<br><br>
            TBFC will continue to figure out a way to keep things interesting
            and viable through all of the chaos the virus and weather throw at
            us. In the meantime, the waters will recede, we will continue with
            meetings, and as I write this, TBFC is optimistically preparing for
            <strong>FossilFest 2021</strong>. I promise you we will figure out a way to get by.
            <br><br>

            <strong>Tampa Bay Fossil Chronicles</strong><br><br>

            Hopefully you’ve noticed that TBFC has stepped up its game with
            the newsletter each month. In addition to all of our regular
            contributors, we’ve added two new recurring articles this season. “In
            Touch with Inverts” by Rob Carlson was added in September. In
            this issue, “Paleo Analysis” by Steve Vicari debuts.
            Each month Steve will be discussing interesting prehistoric fauna and how they
            relate to extant species. <br><br>Please check out all of the articles in each
            issue. <strong>Only TBFC members</strong> receive the Chronicles, we don’t post it online or on Facebook.
            <br><br></p>

            <p>
            In closing, I want to thank all of you for sticking this year out.
            Our membership hasn’t suffered through COVID and your dedication to
            TBFC is appreciated. Please continue to share TBFC with your friends.
            Let likeminded paleo people know TBFC is active and doing well.
            Tune in to the virtual meetings. While I realize it’s not the same
            as live, in person meetings, I think you’ll find them interesting and fun.
            <br><br>
            December typically brings an end to the rain. By the time you read
            this edition of the Chronicles the rivers should be shallow, clear and
            ready for SCUBA diving and screening. Fossil hunting season is
            officially open in Florida! <br><strong>Be sure to renew your
              <a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/vertpaleo/amateur-collector/fossil-permit/" class="links">permits</a>!</strong>
            <br><br CLEAR="left"><br>
            I would like to wish all of you a safe and joyous Christmas,
            Hanukkah and Kwanzaa (or any other holiday I may have missed) and a
            prosperous New Year too. Despite some of the curveballs and
            heartbreak 2020 has thrown at us, I think we can all find something
            to be thankful for.
            <br><br>
            Good hunting! <br>

          <strong>TBFC Returns!</strong>
          <p>Welcome back fossil hunters, it’s that time of year again! The kids
          are back to school (maybe), the dog days of summer will hopefully
          come to an end (maybe not until October), and it’s time to wake the
          Tampa Bay Fossil Club from its summer hibernation! As usual, your
          TBFC Officers and Directors have already been hard at work preparing
          for you another great season of interesting meetings, informative
          lectures, and field trip adventures, COVID allowing! Are you ready?

            Dr. Richard Hulbert, Florida Museum of Natural History
            <br>Introducing the Peace River Paleo Project (PRiPP):
            Research, Outreach, and Education<br><br>
            7PM VIRTUAL MEETING Live on

          Vertebrate fossils collected from the Peace River and its tributaries
          in Hardee and De Soto Counties were the frequent objects of study
          by professional paleontologists between 1880 and 1928. But since
          then very few scientific publications have used Peace River specimens.
          This change was the result of discovery of Florida fossil vertebrate
          localities that greatly exceeded those then known from the
          Peace River in terms of quality and/or quantity of specimens.
          <br><br>When Florida Museum paleontologists began a systematic program
          of collecting river fossils in the 1960s, they concentrated their
          efforts in northern Florida. But thanks to many generous public
          donations, Peace River specimens in Florida Museum collections
          now exceed 2500, some belonging to species never recorded from
          the region in the scientific literature. Over the next two years, UF
          graduate student Mackenzie Ross and Florida Museum collections
          manager Richard Hulbert will lead a project based on this sample.<br><br>
          In addition to traditional paleontological research, including
          description of specimens and analyses of mammalian teeth to make
          inferences about diet and climate, the PRiPP will provide K-12
          science educators in the region with actual and virtual fossil
          specimens along with data and technical support to develop their own
          course curricula and lesson plans dealing with Peace River
          paleontology. The project will also develop multi-media content aimed at
          avocational and recreational fossil collectors, such as on-line
          identification guides, as well as in-home visits to private collections once
          these can be done safely.
