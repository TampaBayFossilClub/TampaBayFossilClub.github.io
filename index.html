          <h1>President's Message</h1>
          <span></span>
          <strong>2022-2023 Season Begins!</strong><br><br>

          Welcome back fossil hunters, it’s that time of year
          again! The kids are back to school, the dog days of summer will
          hopefully come to an end soon, and it’s time to wake the Tampa
          Bay Fossil Club from its summer hibernation! As usual, you’re TBFC
          Officers and Directors have already been hard at work preparing for
          you yet another great season of interesting meetings, informative
          lectures, and as many field trip adventures that we can! Are you
          ready TBFC?<br><br>
          TBFC’s return from our summer break is always an exciting time for
          us all. The University of South Florida has confirmed our schedule
          for the season and it seems there will be no COVID restrictions
          placed on our meetings. All normal activities are being prepared for
          our 2022-2023 season. I want to tell you that we appreciate all of

          your support for TBFC during these past years with COVID. Attendance
          at the meetings was a little low this last season, but most of

          you kept your membership up to date! <br><br>TBFC’s Facebook page continues
          to do great with lots of activity and over 3,000 members.

          Is it too early to say that TBFC survived COVID? It sure seems that

          we did, and we will continue to survive any obstacles the Quaternary
          period has to throw at us. We did have a Jurassic outbreak of

          COVID with TBFC volunteers who set up the club’s wares at the
          Jurassic World Dominion premier. Eight of us showed up to volunteer

          for the event, 4 of us went home with COIVD. We will keep making
          TBFC work as these obstacles persist. In that vein, here we go
          again...

           <br><br>

          <strong>Please keep a watch out for any changes that COVID could cause
          with our scheduled events.</strong><br><br> Read the Chronicles each
          month (Members Only), check
          the calendar here on the TBFC website, and follow us on Facebook. Also,
          please be very cautious while venturing out into the rivers and
          creeks. There’s nothing in those rivers worth dying for.
          <br><br>

              <strong>Denise Neumann<br>
                      1964 – 2022<br>
                      Former TBFC Editor, Director</strong><br><br>

                      Before I close here, I have to
                      tell you the sad news that
                      TBFC’s former editor, Denise
                      Neumann, passed away on
                      June 17. Denise took over our
                      editor duties back in 2007 and
                      did a great job for 8 years

                      until 2015. When Denise vol-
                      unteered to be the editor,

                      TBFC was in a pickle. We had
                      no one who knew how to do
                      the editor job and our first
                      deadline of the season was quickly approaching. Denise stepped
                      forward and said she’d figure it out, and she did. Only after health
                      issues began to slow her down did she give up the position. Not
                      only did she do a great job on the Chronicles, I have to credit Denise
                      with moving the Fossil Chronicles into the digital age. She made it
                      very easy for me when I took over the duties. <br><br>

                      On a personal note, Denise was married to my cousin, so she’d
                      always been family to me. My cousin Altren (Al) couldn’t care less

                      about fossils but he was always there to support Denise in her TBFC
                      and paleo interests. They volunteered for every TBFC event and put

                      in many long hours at FossilFest. We traveled to Nebraska
                      together, went on SCUBA trips in search of fossils, and sometimes just

                      drove around in the car looking for gravel piles at construction sites.
                      Denise was only 57 and had been afflicted with some of the worst
                      health and medical luck you can imagine. The last few years were

                      tough for Denise and her family. <br><br>We love you Denise and will
                      always miss you. Denise leaves behind her beautiful spirit, her
                      husband Altren (Al), son Altren (IV) (wife Carissa), daughter Danielle

                      (husband Rob) and two beautiful grandchildren. Rest in peace.
                      <br><br>
              I look forward to seeing all of you at the meetings this season.

            Dr. Richard Hulbert will retire from his

            position as vertebrate paleontology

            collections manager at the Florida

            Museum of Natural
            History (FLMNH)
            on September 30,
            2022. In this, his
            last talk to TBFC as
            an employee of the

            FLMNH, Dr. Hulbert will reflect on

            his 41-year association with the museum and the major paleo
            discoveries and technological advances occurring over that period.
            He will also look ahead to greatly increased time in his
            “retirement” to conduct research on Florida

            fossils and discuss his plans for a comprehensive program on the

            Pleistocene Mammals of Florida that will include extensive
            collaboration with amateur and hobbyist fossil collectors across the state.
            <br><br>
            Dr. Richard has been a good friend and liaison for the amateur
            community in Florida. His trusted relationship with the amateur fossil

            hunter has probably done more to advance paleontology in Florida
            than any other initiative. We’ll miss Dr. Richard when he’s retired,

            but I can only imagine we’ll see him around. There’s lots of
            research Dr. Richard has had to put off because of other

            projects at the museum. I’m sure it won’t be long before we start
            hearing about his future studies on tapir, horses and other Florida
            mammals.

          <br><br>
          Don’t miss Dr. Hulbert at the September 10 meeting!

        <strong>Tampa Bay Fossil Chronicles</strong><br><br>

        Hopefully you’ve noticed that TBFC has stepped up its game with
        the newsletter each month. In addition to all of our regular
        contributors, we’ve added two new recurring articles this season. “In
        Touch with Inverts” by Rob Carlson was added in September. Recently added, “Paleo Analysis” by Steve Vicari.
        Each month Steve will be discussing interesting prehistoric fauna and how they
        relate to extant species. <br><br>Please check out all of the articles in each
        issue. <strong>Only TBFC members</strong> receive the Chronicles, we don’t post it online or on Facebook.
