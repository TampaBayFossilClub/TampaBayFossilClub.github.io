          <p>This <i>is</i> CRUNCH time. In the next 60 days TBFC has a lot to
            prepare for and a lot of hard work to look forward to.
            FossilFest 2020 is just days away and the Peace River
            Adventure is just a short time after that. We’ll also squeeze
            in a few TBFC meetings, add in some more field trips, and
            throw in a big season ending dinner in June. Whew!
            <br><br>
            <strong>FossilFest 2020 <br>
            March 13, 14 & 15</strong> <br><br>
            FossilFest 2020 is only days away. As I’ve reported to you before,
            the majority of funds TBFC operates on throughout the year are
            generated at our FossilFest event. The event is important to TBFC,
            not just because of the financial earnings though, almost all of
            the media attention that helps attract new members to TBFC is
            received during the weeks leading up to FossilFest. Any help you
            can provide as a volunteer or the donation of needed items is
            greatly appreciated. But you need to act fast, we’re running out
            of time. Please see everything we need in this edition of the
            Chronicles. Please help make FossilFest 2020 another great and
            record breaking event! <br><br>

            March 7, 2020 <br>
            Dr. Sarah Sheffield <br>
            Paleozoic Echinoderms
             <br>
          </strong></span>
          <p>
            Dr. Sheffield comes to us from right here at the University of South
            Florida. Her research interests focus on understanding the
            evolutionary history of life by using Paleozoic echinoderms as a
            model group.
            <br><br>
            Her current projects include: (1) understanding the homologous
            elements of echinoderm skeletons to better understand evolutionary
            relationships; (2) determining the phylogenetic relationships of
            major groups of echinoderms; (3) understanding rates of character
            evolution of certain morphological traits; and (4) finding new
            localities of echinoderm fossils in under sampled geographic areas
            in order to better understand the diversity of life in the
            Paleozoic.
            <br><br>
            Dr. Sheffields presentation focuses on the echinoderms, the group
            that includes sea stars, which have had a unique evolutionary
            history, one that has been difficult to unravel due to many factors.
            Low global sampling and complicated body plating patterns, to name
            a few. This lecture explores the evolutionary history of blastozoan
            echinoderms, an extinct and diverse group that lived in
            the Paleozoic Era hundreds of millions of years ago, and how their
            evolution can inform us of larger global patterns through time.

            <strong>Peace River Adventure <br>
            April 25 & 26 2020</strong> <br><br>
            The Peace River Adventure has turned into one of TBFC’s most
            popular outings. Years ago we worried if we’d get enough
            participation to make the event worth the work, now we worry if we
            can handle the large crowd.
            <br><br>
            With FossilFest comes many new members, some who have never set
            foot into a river or mine in search of fossilized creatures from
            the past. The Peace River trip has become these folk’s freshman
            outing in paleontology and the perfect opportunity to learn how to
            hunt for their very own fossils. The trip is also a reunion for
            many of us who have attended the event for over 20 years.
            <br><br>
            The Peace River Adventure is a wonderful family outing and the
            <strong>only</strong> TBFC fieldtrip when we invite non-members to
            join in on the hunt. This is your opportunity to introduce friends
            and family to TBFC and Florida’s prehistoric past. The river is at
            its shallowest level and accessible by hunters of all ages (when
            Mother Nature cooperates).
            <br><br>
            The Peace River Adventure will take new and seasoned fossil hunters
            into the beautiful Peace River near Zolfo Springs. An afternoon
            barbeque dinner, benefit auction, and campfires galore will follow
            the day of fossil hunting. On top of all of that, the Peace River
            Adventure boasts some of TBFC’s hottest selling t-shirts of the
            year. You can find registration forms in this edition of the
            Chronicles. Sign up early!
            <br><br>
            Special note: If you would like to hunt from Thousand Trails Park,
            you do have to stay at their campground.
            <br><br>
            This weekend trip only comes around once a year (with some folks
            arriving even earlier in the week). If you have any questions, feel
            free to contact me: (813) 909-9358 or fossilnerd@msn.com). And, if
            you’re interested in volunteering at the event for a couple hours,
            please let me know.
            <br><br>
            <strong>TBFC, it’s going to be a busy few months!</strong>
            <br><br>
            Good and safe hunting to you!<br>
