        <p>This sure is a busy time of the year for all of us here at TBFC.
          In the next three or four months we’ll need to get in four more
          monthly meetings, eight or more field trips, and the largest paleo
          show in the south, FossilFest 2020! As soon as we get FossilFest
          closed and back into its box, we’ll be loading up for the Peace River
          Adventure. The Peace River Adventure is TBFC’s largest annual field
          trip where hundreds of people will gather for a “paleo” weekend. With
          the help of the Officers, Directors, and good folks like you,
          everything will be accomplished and we’ll have a great time doing
          it. <strong>Please read through TBFC’s volunteer needs for FossilFest
          in this edition of the Chronicles.</strong></p>

          Fulgurites, Fossilizing Lightning in Florida <br>
          Dr, Matthew Pasek <br>
        </strong></span>
        <p>
          The energy behind the blinding light, deafening crackle and lingering
          sizzle of a lightning strike can now be measured with more precision
          than ever, thanks to years of research by Dr. Matthew Pasek. <br><br>

          His findings show that a majority of lightning strikes are more
          powerful than even he expected. <br><br>

          Pasek and his team are the first to determine the power of a strike
          by examining what it leaves behind: hollow icicle-like glass tubes
          called fulgurites. <br><br>

          A strike can heat surrounding air to 53,000 degrees Fahrenheit. When
          lightning hits sand, the intense heat vaporizes and melts the quartz
          in anywhere from a millionth to a thousandth of a second. Then, as
          the ground quickly cools, fulgurites are instantly formed. <br><br>

          About 10 fulgurites are formed globally per second, Pasek says,
          though lightning hits the Earth about 45 times per second. Those
          strikes are usually on land, but fulgurites form only when lightning
          comes in contact with sand, soil, rock or clay. <br><br>

          Dr. Pasek has studied more than 267 fulgurites, some of which could
          be thousands of years old, from CC Calhoun Inc.'s sand mines in Polk
          County. The mines are near Bok Tower Gardens in Lake Wales, a high
          point in the state. <br><br>

          It traditionally has been difficult for atmospheric physicists to
          accurately measure the energy of a lightning strike. The best
          methods available involve sending bottle rockets loaded with copper
          wires into lightning strikes to measure electrical wattage or using
          a radio tower to measure current and temperature of a strike. <br><br>

          Come hear Dr. Pasek’s presentation on lighting strikes. Some of
          these fulgurites are as old as the Ice Age. <br><br>


          <strong>FossilFest 2020 <br>
          March 13, 14 & 15</strong> <br><br>
          As we turn our calendars to 2020, FossilFest is just a few months
          away. It will take our entire TBFC tribe to pull it off. In this
          issue of the Chronicles you will find a long list of information
          about volunteering for the event and all of the items we need to
          have donated. Please take a few minutes to read through the entire
          list. <br><br>

          <strong>FOSSILFEST NEEDS YOU!</strong> <br>
          I hope to see another good crowd at the January meeting. <br><br>

          Good and safe hunting to you! <br><br>
