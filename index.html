            This is CRUNCH time. <br><br>In the next 90 days TBFC has a lot to prepare
            for and a lot of hard work too. FossilFest 2023 is just weeks away
            and the Peace River Adventure (in some format) is just a short
            time after that. We’ll also squeeze in a few more TBFC meetings,
            add in some more field trips, and throw in a big season ending
            dinner in June. Are you ready TBFC!<br><br>

           <strong>Peace River "Mini" Adventure</strong.<br><br>
             April 28th 2023<br><br>
             The Peace River Adventure has turned into one of TBFC’s most
             popular outings. Years ago we worried if we’d get enough
             participation to make the event even worth the work. Now, we
             sometimes worry if we can accommodate everyone who wants to
             attend. I should say, that was before COVID, and the hurricanes
             during the past year.<br><br>
             We have hoped that we would be able to run the entire weekend
             event, it appears that damage from the Hurricane Ian though, will
             prevent that from happening.<br><br>
             With FossilFest comes many new members, some who have never
             set foot into a river or mine in search of fossilized creatures from
             the past. The Peace River trip has become these folk’s freshman
             outing in paleontology and the perfect opportunity to learn how to
             hunt for their very own fossils. The trip has also become a sort of
             reunion for many of us who have attended the event for decades.
             Even though we have had in excess of 300 people show up for the
             Peace River Adventure’s weekend event, when we downsized to a
             single day of hunting because of COVID there was little participation.
             And I mean “little”. Despite that, we will press forward to
             provide an advertised day of hunting for our new members that
             we pick up during FossilFest. These folks will be biting at the bit to
             get out and hunt some fossils and we will be ready for them.
             The Peace River Adventure is a wonderful family outing and the
             only TBFC fieldtrip when we invite non-members to join in on the
             hunt. This is your opportunity to introduce friends and family to
             TBFC and Florida’s prehistoric past. The river is at its shallowest
             level and accessible by hunters of all ages (when Mother Nature
             cooperates).
             <br><br>

          <!--<strong>Please keep a watch out for any changes that COVID could cause
          with our scheduled events.</strong><br><br>--> Read the Chronicles each
          month (Members Only), check
          the calendar here on the TBFC website, and follow us on Facebook. Also,
          please be very cautious while venturing out into the rivers and
          creeks. There’s nothing in those rivers worth dying for.

          </p>

          <br><br>
              Good Hunting, <br>

          <p>
            Whether you make a “big” find
            or just pick up
            another common
            fossil, there’s a
            process that

            starts with finding the specimen, all the way

            to putting it on
            your shelf for
            display. Or, if
            you’re lucky,
            donating it to a

            museum collection. Many of have perfected the art of finding fossils.
            There’s also a bunch of us, myself included, who have neglected to
            properly clean, repair, preserve and log every find we bring

            home. Dr. Bob will discuss proper discipline with the processing of
            the fossils. His discussion will explain everything from getting
            your specimen out of the ground to the shelf in a safe and ethical
            manner.<br><br>

            Everybody
            knows Dr. Bob,
            at least those of
            you that have
            been to a
            meeting or two.

            A longtime member of TBFC, past

            president, and
            current Board
            member, Dr. Bob
            is certainly active
            in the paleo
            community and a big part of what makes TBFC tick. Did I mention
            he is also an author with four paleo books to his credit? I’ll throw
            a plug in here for the Paleo-Store where you can purchase any, or
            all, of Dr. Bob’s books: Ice Age Florida in Story and Art, What Your
            Fossils Can Tell You: Vertebrate Morphology, Pathology, and
            Cultural Modification, Fossil Diving: In Florida’s Waters or Any
            Other Waters Containing Prehistoric Treasures, and The Handbook of Paleontological Terms.

        <h2>Tampa Bay Fossil Chronicles</h2><br>

        Hopefully you’ve noticed that TBFC has stepped up its game with
        the newsletter each month. In addition to all of our regular
        contributors, we’ve added two new recurring articles this season. “In
        Touch with Inverts” by Rob Carlson was added in September. Recently added, “Paleo Analysis” by Steve Vicari.
        Each month Steve will be discussing interesting prehistoric fauna and how they
        relate to extant species. <br><br>Please check out all of the articles in each
        issue. <strong>Only TBFC members</strong> receive the Chronicles, we don’t post it online or on Facebook.
