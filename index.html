          <h1>President's Message</h1>
          <span></span>
          <strong>TBFC – 2021-2022 Season Begins!</strong><br><br>

          Well, we did it. After a 15 month absence, we were able to meet in
          person at USF for our first meeting of the 2021-2022 season. While
          we are all a little out of practice, it seemed to go well and we had

          about seventy people in attendance. Everyone enjoyed the presentation
          on Eocene mammals by Dr. Jonathan Bloch. We gave out

          some prizes and even awarded a few plaques to folks for service in
          TBFC.<br><br>
          <img src="img/temp/HonorableMention2021.png" alt="Eileen Durkin Receiving Honorable Mention Award"
            class="body-img-sm" ALIGN="right" style="padding: 0px 10px 0px 0px;">

          <img src="img/temp/MarvinPresAwards2021.png" alt="Mike and Bob Receive Marvin Preston Awards"
            class="body-img-sm" ALIGN="left" style="padding: 0px 10px 0px 0px;">
          I want to thank Dr. Sinibaldi for his hard work over the decades. He
          is a well deserving recipient of the Marvin Preston Club Service
          Award.

          Also receiving an award was Eileen Durkin for her gracious

          help during COVID in keeping TBFC’s presence online and her invaluable
          assistance in hosting our virtual meetings on YouTube live.

          Thank you both.


          I too was honored as a recipient of the Marvin Preston Club Service
          Award. I am thankful for the award and will tell you all that the
          work I’ve done over the past decades for TBFC has been nothing
          but rewarding. My first meeting as president of TBFC was just three
          days before the 9/11 attacks. All of our speakers for the remainder
          of 2001 canceled on us. Later we were displaced from USF because
          of the al-Arian terrorist threat. Between Barbara Fite, my wife
          Seina, and the rest of the Board, we pulled it all together. We
          found speakers, found a place to meet, and eventually talked our
          way back into USF.<br><br>
          While the Marvin Preston Club Service Award thanks me for my
          service, in turn I thank all of you and TBFC. As I say in my article
          here at the close of each season, “Thanks for the adventure TBFC!”

          <br><br>
          I need to thank Dr. Jonathan Bloch for making the long drive to
          Tampa to meet with us. Everyone gets excited when we get folks
          from the Florida Museum of Natural History to speak, and for good
          reason. Lots of members brought along fossils to show off and have
          identified by Dr. Bloch, heck Dave Hoffman brought along a whole
          box of cool fossils.
            <br><br>

          <strong>Field Trips</strong><br><br>
          Despite Marlin Swikert’s best efforts, all of the mines we hunt will
          remain closed to visitors through the end of 2021. On the bright
          side, Fred Hendershot predicts that all of the rains and flooding
          should make for a great fossil hunting season in the rivers when the
          water levels finally do subside. We have also added a Venice shark
          tooth dive to our field trips on October 16. If it’s successful, we’ll
          make that a regular trip on our schedule. Thanks to member Doug
          Woodring and Top 2 Bottom Charters for helping make the dive trip
          possible.<br><br>

          <strong>Please keep a watch out for any changes that COVID could cause
          with our scheduled events.</strong><br><br> Read the Chronicles each
          month (Members Only), check
          the calendar here on the TBFC website, and follow us on Facebook. Also,
          please be very cautious while venturing out into the rivers and
          creeks. At the time of this writing we are seeing flood stage
          conditions in most waterways. There’s nothing in those rivers worth
          dying for.
          <br><br>
          <strong>A few things for the remainder of 2021...</strong><br><br>
          We will meet in November
          for our annual auction. Attendance in the past for this event

          has been low, despite some great auction items (and good company).
          We really need the boost for scholarship revenue, so I’d like to

          invite everyone to show up for a good time. If you have auction
          items to donate, please bring them along, or contact me in advance

          if you need someone to pick them up. I’d really appreciate any sup-
          port we can get for the auction.
          <br><br>
          There will be <strong>no meeting in December.</strong> Not necessarily by choice,
          but more of a scheduling conflict with USF. Hopefully this won’t be
          a recurring problem.

          Come January we will need to hit the ground running. Despite continuing
          challenges with COVID, FossilFest 2022 is a GO! The Peace

          River Adventure is a GO! I say both with enthusiasm... unless COVID
          shuts down the world again.<br><br>
          With positive thoughts on all of our futures, I hope to see you all at

          the October meeting. To all of you kids, “BOO”, have a great Halloween!

          </p>
            <p>
            Good Hunting! <br>

            Guest Speaker: David Letasi - Terror Pigs and Walking Whales!
            <br><br>
            7PM IN-PERSON CLUB MEETING at the <a href="meetings.html">USF
              Behavioral Science Room #103</a> <br>We will also try to be Live on

            but the live stream quality is not guarnteed and the stream might
            not even work! But we will try! (Note: some speakers may not want to be filmed).
          </strong></span>
          <p>
            David Letasi has been interested in fossils and pre-historic times

            since he was eight years old and thus has had many years’ experience
            searching for fossils all over North America and Asia. By age

            twelve, he had discovered three archeological sites that are recorded
            in the Michigan State Archeological Site Survey. In addition to

            dinosaurs, Letasi has studied prehistoric man, ancient world history,
            and archeology.<br><br>
            After serving in the Navy, he decided to travel around the United

            States to collect specimens from well-known fossil sites in Wyoming,
            Nebraska, South Dakota, and Florida, as well as Canada and

            several countries in Asia. After he married his wife, Suzanne, in
            1972 she began to travel with him. In 1976 they moved to Florida
            where it was possible to collect saber-tooth cat fossils, his main
            field of interest.<br><br>
            Dave worked for Great Explorations Museum in St Petersburg and

            assumed a number of duties, including designing and curating exhibits
            and later worked at the Museum of Science and Industry

            (MOSI) in Tampa. While at MOSI, he led cave explorations for
            children and adults to the Dames Cave in the Withlacoochee State
            Foest, as well as fossil-collecting trips to mining sites in Polk County.

            Since retiring from MOSI in 2007, he has been active in projects
            with the Historic Hernando Preservation Society.<br><br>
            His lengthy résumé includes being the lead archaeological project

            coordinator with the Historic Hernando County Preservation Society,
            the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and the Gulf Archaeology Research
            Institute of Gainesville. Some interesting projects he’s

            worked on include searching for the eighteenth-century capital of
            the Seminole Nation and the exploration of the Bayport Civil War
            shipwreck site.<br><br>
            Dave’s presentation will discuss “Terror Pigs and Walking Whales",
            the convergent relationship between the Cetacea and primitive

            Artiodactals. This lecture will follow the research and paleontological
            history of the discovery of vertebrate fossils of early whales and

            their cousins the Entelodonts.

        <strong>Tampa Bay Fossil Chronicles</strong><br><br>

        Hopefully you’ve noticed that TBFC has stepped up its game with
        the newsletter each month. In addition to all of our regular
        contributors, we’ve added two new recurring articles this season. “In
        Touch with Inverts” by Rob Carlson was added in September. Recently added, “Paleo Analysis” by Steve Vicari.
        Each month Steve will be discussing interesting prehistoric fauna and how they
        relate to extant species. <br><br>Please check out all of the articles in each
        issue. <strong>Only TBFC members</strong> receive the Chronicles, we don’t post it online or on Facebook.
