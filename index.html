          <h2>2022-2023 Season</h2>
          <br>
          <strong>People “DIG” FossilFest! </strong>(Pun intended)<br><br>
          Wow... What a weekend. Once again, what a successful show! I
          couldn’t be more pleased with the results and it sure feels good to
          get the COVID effect behind us. FossilFest had decent coverage on
          television and it sure brought in a great crowd.<br><br>
          We have three major goals each year at FossilFest; earn funds to
          operate TBFC through the year, teach the public about Florida’s
          prehistory, and reach out to new members. We accomplished all
          of that! It looks like we had 35 new families sign up as members
          with TBFC at FossilFest and over 20 renewals. That in itself is a
          great success! If you’re one of those new members that signed up
          for the adventure, welcome to the Tampa Bay Fossil Club!
          Everyone worked very hard, some for three hours, some for three
          days (some for weeks and months leading up to the show).

          <br><br>

          I have to thank all of TBFC’s Officers, Directors, and ALL of the
          members who volunteered to make the show the success that it
          was. We certainly couldn’t have done it without you. If you were
          one of the 130 plus volunteers during the show, thank you. From
          the admissions, to the silent auction, donations, club sales, kids
          mine, set up, break down, security, and everything in-between, I
          can’t thank you all enough.
          I get lots of accolades and slaps on the back during FossilFest. I
          always tell everyone what a great support staff I, and FossilFest,
          have. FossilFest 2023 was a huge success, and that’s because of all
          of you.
          So, I have to ask... Are you still tired from FossilFest? Sorry, no
          time to sit down; TBFC’s season isn’t over yet.<br><br>
          We’re just getting started!<br><br>

           <strong>Peace River "Mini" Adventure</strong>.<br><br>
             April 29th 2023<br><br>
             The Peace River Adventure has turned into one of
             TBFC’s most popular outings. Years ago we worried if we’d get enough participation

to make the event even worth the work. Now, we sometimes worry
if we can accommodate everyone who wants to attend. That was
before COVID though, and now the hurricanes during the past year.
We have hoped that we would be able to run the entire weekend
event in 2023. It appears that damage from Hurricane Ian though

will prevent that from happening.
We did run a Mini Adventure last, but it wasn’t well received.

With FossilFest comes many new members, some who have

never set foot into a river or mine in search of fossilized creatures from the past. The Peace River trip has become these

folk’s freshman outing in paleontology and the perfect opportunity to learn how to hunt for their very own fossils. The trip

has also become a sort of reunion for many of us who have
attended the event for decades.
Even though we have had in excess of 300 people show up for

the Peace River Adventure’s weekend event, when we downsized to a single day of hunting because of COVID there was

little participation. And I mean “little”. I guess without the
camping, BBQ, auction and Dr. Bob’s famous campfire pie

night, we just aren’t
going to get as many
people to come out.
Despite that, we will

press forward to provide an advertised day

of hunting for our
new members that
we picked up during
FossilFest. These
folks will be biting at
the bit to get out and
hunt some fossils and
we will be ready for
them.
<br><br>
The Peace River Adventure is a wonderful family outing and

the only TBFC fieldtrip

when we invite non-members to join in on

the hunt. This is your

opportunity to introduce friends and fam-
ily to TBFC and Florida’s prehistoric past.

The river is at its shallowest level and accessible by hunters of

all ages (when Mother
Nature cooperates).<br><br>
We will be doing both
a walk-in screening and a canoe trip on April 29, both starting at
9AM. Screeners should meet at <strong>Peace River Park 1322 E. Main St.,
Wauchula</strong>. For canoe and kayak, meet at <strong>100 Park Drive (north East
Main Street bridge) Wauchula, Florida 33873</strong>.
             <br><br>

          <!--<strong>Please keep a watch out for any changes that COVID could cause
          with our scheduled events.</strong><br><br>--> Read the Chronicles each
          month (Members Only), check
          the calendar here on the TBFC website, and follow us on Facebook. Also,
          please be very cautious while venturing out into the rivers and
          creeks. There’s nothing in those rivers worth dying for.

          <br><br>

          In closing, I want to again say thank you to everyone who helped out
this past month. Thank you for making FossilFest, and everything else
about TBFC so great.<br><br>
I look forward to seeing all the new faces at the April meeting.

          </p>

              Good Hunting, <br>

          <p>
            Dr. Jonathan Bloch joined the Florida Museum in 2004 as an assistant
            curator of vertebrate paleontology. He continues his duties and

            research as a curator of vertebrate paleontology, a position he has

            held since 2014. Bloch, who has co-authored more than 90
            professional publications, is also a University of Florida Term Professor and

            serves on the editorial board for the Journal of Mammalian Evolution.

            “While I will have less time for my own fieldwork and research than I
            am used to, I know the vertebrate paleontology division will be as

            productive as ever thanks to our enormously talented and hardworking team of staff, volunteers and students,” Bloch said.
<br><br>
            Dr. Bloch has been featured in many television documentaries including
            his legendary Amazon python bite scene while filming to

            support the titanoboa discovery.<br><br>
            Join TBFC for another great presentation from Dr. Jonathan Bloch.

        <h2>Tampa Bay Fossil Chronicles</h2><br>

        Hopefully you’ve noticed that TBFC has stepped up its game with
        the newsletter each month. In addition to all of our regular
        contributors, we’ve added two new recurring articles this season. “In
        Touch with Inverts” by Rob Carlson was added in September. Recently added, “Paleo Analysis” by Steve Vicari.
        Each month Steve will be discussing interesting prehistoric fauna and how they
        relate to extant species. <br><br>Please check out all of the articles in each
        issue. <strong>Only TBFC members</strong> receive the Chronicles, we don’t post it online or on Facebook.
