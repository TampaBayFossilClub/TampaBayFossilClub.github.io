        <p>This sure is a busy time of the year for all of us here at TBFC.
          In the next three or four months we’ll need to get in four more
          monthly meetings, eight or more field trips, and the largest paleo
          show in the south, FossilFest 2020! As soon as we get FossilFest
          closed and back into its box, we’ll be loading up for the Peace River
          Adventure. The Peace River Adventure is TBFC’s largest annual field
          trip where hundreds of people will gather for a “paleo” weekend. With
          the help of the Officers, Directors, and good folks like you,
          everything will be accomplished and we’ll have a great time doing
          it. <strong>Please read through TBFC’s volunteer needs for FossilFest
          in this edition of the Chronicles.</strong></p>
