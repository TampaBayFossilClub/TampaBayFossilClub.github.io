          <br>
          <strong>Crunch Time!</strong>

          <br><br>

          This is crunch time and we’re all running around like dinosaurs with
our heads cut off (get it?). In the next 90 days TBFC has a lot to
prepare for and a lot of hard work too. FossilFest 2025 is just
weeks away. Before the close of the 2024-25 season we’ll squeeze
in a few more TBFC meetings, a bunch of field trips, and throw in a
big season ending dinner in June. Are you ready TBFC!?<br><br>

<strong>Will there be a Peace River Adventure in 2025?</strong>
<br><br>Folks keep asking,
but I just don’t know. I haven’t even had the chance yet to talk
with the folks down south to see if the venues were damaged during the
hurricanes. I will post here soon if you need to “save the date”.

          <br><br>
          <strong>Rare Irvingtonian Site Discovered</strong><br>
          <a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/science/underwater-fossil-bed-discovered-by-collectors-preserves-rare-slice-of-floridas-past/" class="links">University of Florida Article</a> <br><br>
          Two years ago, TBFC members
          Joe Branin and Dr. Bob Sinibaldi discovered a rare and scientifically
          important fossil site while SCUBA diving in north Florida. Over the
          past two years they have worked closely with the Florida Museum

          of Natural History (FLMNH) to unravel the mystery behind the
          extraordinary and unusual fossils found at their site. It’s big news in

          the paleo community and national news outlets like Science Daily,
          Popular Science, and Discovery BBC, are reporting on the discovery.
          There is a complete article about the discovery in this issue of the
          Fossil Chronicles, so I won’t go into the detail here. I do want to
          take the time to acknowledge both Joe and Dr. Bob for their special
          discovery and for their dedication to amateur paleontology.
<br><br>
          For most of us in the club, finding a nice fossil specimen is just
          another addition to our personal collections and displays. We all
          enjoy hunting for fossil specimens and learning about what we find.

          When you are lucky enough to find something so rare that it has
          significant scientific value, let alone a site containing hundreds of
          scientifically valuable fossils, some folks might find it hard to do the
          right thing. Many of the specimens Joe and Dr. Bob found are the
          finds of a lifetime that would make their personal collections truly

          extraordinary. Some fossil hunters may consider the overall monetary
          value of finding hundreds of exceptional specimens (although I

          know most of you would never sell a cool fossil you found). I can
          tell you from experience that when the collection manager from
          the FLMNH shows up to your fossil room to pack up the absolute
          best fossils you’ve ever found, it really stings.<br><br>
          There was never a doubt in mind that Joe and Dr. Bob wouldn’t
          alert the FLMNH and never a doubt in mind that both men wouldn’t
          hand over to the museum all the scientifically significant fossils
          from their site. Nonetheless, I still want to say how proud I am of
          them for the great job they continue to do with their site and that
          they are excellent examples of what makes the Florida Fossil Permit
          system work for all of us. Congratulations to you both.

Demise of the Mega Beast: a 50,000-Year-Old Mystery  <br>
   with Dr. Advait Jukar, Florida Museum of Natural History<br>

            <br>
            7PM IN-PERSON CLUB MEETING at the <a href="meetings.html" class="links">USF
              Behavioral Science Room #103</a>
              <!--<br>There will NOT be a livestream but the meeting will be recorded.

          </strong></span><br>
          <p>
            Dr. Advait Jukar was appointed the Assistant Curator of Vertebrate
Paleontology position which was vacated by the long-standing Dr.
Bruce MacFadden in late 2024. Dr. Jukar received his master’s and

PhD in Environmental Science and Policy from George Mason University and a
Bachelor’s in Biology from Reed College. Before coming to Florida, Dr. Jukar
was the Lecturer of Paleontology at the

University of Arizona, a Gaylord Donnelly Postdoctoral Fellow at

Yale, and a Deep Time Peter Buck Postdoctoral Fellow at the Smithsonian’s
National Museum of Natural History.
<br><br>
Dr. Jukar’s research focuses on the ecology and evolution of terrestrial
ecosystems. Much of his research has centered on the paleoecology and
systematics of subtropical and tropical mammals from

the Indian Subcontinent, but he has also conducted field work most
recently in India, but also in Georgia, New Jersey, and Montana. He
also has a soft spot for the fossil record of elephants and their kin,
and the history of paleontology.<br><br>
In addition to his research, Dr. Jukar has helped design museum
exhibitions at the Yale Peabody Museum and for the Smithsonian’s

Deep Time Fossil Halls. He has also developed public outreach activities on the
evolution of elephants, dinosaurs, and whales, has

advised the Indian Government on establishing museums, and is
actively involved in the world of biodiversity policy.
<br><br>
Dr. Jukar’s presentation, Demise of the Mega Beasts: a 50,000-Year-Old Murder
Mystery - 50,000 years ago these prehistoric animals lived everywhere.
Today, they’re mostly found in Africa
and parts of Asia. Florida was home to
bison, glyptodonts, giant ground
sloths, saber cats, and mammoths.
But why did they disappear suddenly?
Did early modern humans hunt large,

land-dwelling megafauna to extinction as they migrated to new continents,
or is climate change to blame instead? Dr. Jukar will discuss

cutting edge research about the megafauna extinction and how paleontologists
approach the debate surrounding the causes.

        <h2>Tampa Bay Fossil Chronicles</h2><br>

        Hopefully you’ve noticed that TBFC has stepped up its game with
        the newsletter each month. In addition to all of our regular
        contributors, we’ve added two new recurring articles this season. “In
        Touch with Inverts” by Rob Carlson was added in September. Recently added, “Paleo Analysis” by Steve Vicari.
        Each month Steve will be discussing interesting prehistoric fauna and how they
        relate to extant species. <br><br>Please check out all of the articles in each
        issue. <strong>Only TBFC members</strong> receive the Chronicles, we don’t post it online or on Facebook.
