          <br>
          <strong>TBFC Returns!</strong><br><br>

          Welcome back fossil hunters, it’s that time of year
          again! The kids are back to school, the dog days of summer will
          hopefully come to an end soon, and it’s time to wake the Tampa
          Bay Fossil Club from its summer hibernation! As usual, your TBFC
          Officers and Directors have already been hard at work preparing

          for you yet another great season of interesting meetings, informative
          lectures, and as many field trip adventures as we can! Are you

          ready TBFC?<br><br>
          TBFC’s return from our summer break is an exciting time for us all.

          And we are all hopeful for a complete return to our normal activities.
          While we didn’t experience any COVID problems with the

          previous season, Hurricane Ian did cause us to change the Peace

          River Adventure into a Mini Adventure. A dangerous algae outbreak
          in the Peace River though, just two days prior to the Mini
          Adventure, caused a last minute canceling of that event. I’m very
          sorry for the last-minute notice on that cancellation. We literally
          found out about the dangerous conditions just the day before the
          event.<br><br>
          Short of any worldwide viruses, devastating hurricanes, or green
          slime outbreaks, all normal activities are being prepared for in our
          2023-2024 season. I want to tell you that we appreciate all your
          support for TBFC during these past years with all the cancellations
          and last-minute adjustments we’ve had to make. Here we go...

          <strong>Sad News</strong><br><br>

          I am often tasked here with reporting to you the sad news of folks
          in our fossil community who have passed away. Over the summer
          two close friends of mine, and friends of many of you who have

          hunted in the Nebraska Badlands passed away. In May Mike Kesselring
          of High Plains Homestead fame died unexpectedly at his
          home in Harrison, Nebraska. Less than two months later Gerry
          Pettipiece lost her battle with heart disease in Chadron, NE.
          Both Mike and Gerry, in their own ways, were very important to
          paleontology in the Nebraska Panhandle region.

          <p>
            Luis Torres is a born and raised South Florida native, who grew up
  to have a strong appreciation for the natural world, for both the

  present and the past. It was in this natural world that he
  discovered some chalky, fossilized remains of marine invertebrates from

  a past age. This discovery led him to pursue his curiosity and develop
  a love for all things paleontology, invertebrate or otherwise.

  Luis first attended Florida Atlantic University (FAU), where he
  obtained a bachelor’s degree in biology. This was followed by working as
  a docent at the Palm Beach Museum of Natural History and

  as a FAU Lab Technician for a few years while he worked toward a
  master’s degree in geological sciences which he finished in the
  Summer of 2022. Luis is currently working on earning a PhD in

  geological sciences at the University of Florida. His studies of invertebrate
  paleontology alongside the Florida Museum of Natural

  History are further developing his skills as both a scientist and science
  communicator.<br><br>

  Saber Toothed Cats, Assassins of the Ice Age - Among the most
  recognizable and renowned predators of the post-dinosaur era,
  saber-toothed cats are known not only for their long, dagger-like
  canine teeth, but for their brutal and unique hunting style that
  allowed them to dispatch large prey with an efficiency not seen in
  other felines. In Luis’ presentation we will talk about the many

  different species of saber-toothed cats, where they evolved, how
  they lived, and why we believe that their long, knife-like canines
  that allowed them to dominate for millions of years, may have led
  to their eventual downfall in the face of a rapidly changing world.

        <h2>Tampa Bay Fossil Chronicles</h2><br>

        Hopefully you’ve noticed that TBFC has stepped up its game with
        the newsletter each month. In addition to all of our regular
        contributors, we’ve added two new recurring articles this season. “In
        Touch with Inverts” by Rob Carlson was added in September. Recently added, “Paleo Analysis” by Steve Vicari.
        Each month Steve will be discussing interesting prehistoric fauna and how they
        relate to extant species. <br><br>Please check out all of the articles in each
        issue. <strong>Only TBFC members</strong> receive the Chronicles, we don’t post it online or on Facebook.
