          <h2>2023-2024 Season</h2>
          <br>
          <strong>Tampa Bay Fossil Club</strong><br><br>

          <strong>People “DIG” FossilFest! (Pun intended)</strong><br><br>
  What a weekend. Once again, another successful FossilFest! I

  couldn’t be more pleased with the results. FossilFest had good cov-
  erage on both television and social media, and it sure brought in a

  good crowd. Saturday started a little slow, but I think we did okay.
  Boy, it was a hot one though. Our air conditioning bill was through
  the roof.<br><br>
  We have three major goals each year at FossilFest; earn funds to
  operate TBFC through the year, teach the public about Florida’s
  prehistory, and reach out to new members. We accomplished all of
  that! It looks like we had 33 new families join TBFC at FossilFest
  and 52 renewals during the month of March. That in itself is a great
  success! If you’re one of those new members that signed up for
  the adventure, welcome to the Tampa Bay Fossil Club!
  Everyone worked very hard, some for three hours, some for three
  days (some for weeks and months leading up to the show). I hate
  to thank individual volunteers by name in this writing, but I have to
  mention a few people here. TBFC Director Joe Branin and David

  Faucher spent the night on the FossilFest floor both Friday and Saturday n
  ight to stand sentinel for the show. That’s about 56 straight

  hours at FossilFest for these guys!<br><br>

  I must thank my wife Seina for working on the volunteer assignments for
  months ahead of the show, and many of the other details

  at Fossilfest that just seem to “happen” because of her. Every year

  for as long as I can remember Barbara Fite has worked on scheduling the
  vendors and taken care of many other aspects of FossilFest.

  She also handles other problems as they occur during the three-day
  event. Barbara and Jerry Zolg spend many hours leading up to the
  show arranging and rearranging the floor plan to fit our needs, and

  sometimes the last-minute changes that have to happen. Our FossilFest
  trailer is 20 feet long and weighs in excess of 6 tons. We

  need a huge truck to make that move and for many years Mike Burnett
  (and his wife Jessica) have driven from Bradenton, Florida to

  pick up the trailer in Zephyrhills where it is stored on the property
  of TBFC members Darren and Nicole Watts. By the time Mike
  drives to Zephyrhills, hooks up, drives back to the fairgrounds, and
  then back home to Bradenton, it’s a eight-hour day. He does this
  on Friday, in morning traffic, and then again on Sunday afternoon.
  Hidden in all of the excitement of FossilFest is Bill Faucher collecting
  money, making change, and getting cash money safely to the bank.<br><br>

  Joe Dumont spent two days at the “ID” table and made sure everything was
  back in the trailer on Sunday afternoon. Dr. Bob Sinibaldi

  assists me with television appearances and does two presentations
  each day at FossilFest. Dr. Leslie Branin hauled a metric ton of
  books to the show. Fred Hendershot spent the entire weekend
  with kids at the Touch Table. Also working with the kids, was Pat
  Appledorn and Debbie Porter who managed the Kid’s Mine for the
  entire weekend. It takes a bunch of patience to deal with all of the
  excitement in the kid’s area. Marlin Swikert runs the Silent auction
  all weekend like a well-oiled machine. And that’s just some of the
  big things that get done... I am so sorry I can’t mention everyone
  here in this writing.<br><br>

  We had several people travel from out of state to volunteer at FossilFest.
  Debbie Porter from Atlanta and John Campbell from
  Massachusetts are two I know of.<br><br>

  Again, I hate to mention individuals here because I know I’ll forget
  somebody who did an above the “call of duty job” and there were
  too many people to name that spent three entire days at FossilFest.
  I have to thank all of TBFC’s Officers, Directors, and ALL of the 135
  members who volunteered to make the show the success that it
  was. We certainly couldn’t have done it without you. If you were

  one of the volunteers, thank you. From the admissions, to the silent auction,
  donations, club sales, kids mine, set up, break down,

  security, and everything in-between, I can’t thank you all enough.
  I receive lots of accolades and slaps on the back during FossilFest. I

  want you all to know that I always tell everyone what a great support
  staff I, and FossilFest, have. FossilFest 2024 was a huge success,
  and that’s because of all of you.

  <br><br>

  So, I have to ask... Are you still tired from FossilFest? Sorry, no
  time to sit down; TBFC’s season isn’t over yet.
  We’re just getting started! <br><br>

          (set up on March 15). The show is big, one of the biggest amateur
          run shows in the country. It takes a lot of volunteers to operate FossilFest and some folks have already started
          working on Fossilfest 2024. <br><br>

          <br><br>
          <strong> Peace River Canoe & Screening Day </strong><br><br>

          The Peace River Adventure has turned into one of TBFC’s most popular
          outings. Years ago we worried if we’d get enough participation
          to make the event even worth the work. Then we worried if we
          could accommodate everyone who wants to attend. That was before
          COVID though, and hurricanes, toxic algae blooms, and now
          winter/spring rains.
          <br><br>
          We’ve hoped to run the entire weekend event in 2024. However, it
          appears that water levels may be too deep. At the time of this
          writing the measurement at Zolfo Springs is nearly 7 feet. We need
          it at 6 feet, or below to hold a safe hunt. Despite that, we will press
          forward in attempting to hold an advertised day of hunting for our
          new members that we pick up during FossilFest. These folks will be
          biting at the bit to get out and hunt some fossils and we will be
          ready for them.<br><br>
          We’ll watch the weather and water levels and shoot for a day of
          canoeing and/or screen washing on April 27.

          <br><br>

          In closing, I want to again say thank you again to everyone who

helped this past month. Thank you for making FossilFest, and everything else
about TBFC so great.<br><br>

I look forward to seeing all the new faces at the April meeting.

          </p>

  If you’re new to TBFC, prepare yourself for Dr. Bob. If you already
  know Dr. Bob, you know that you can expect to learn a lot from his

  presentations. You also know to expect a lot of humor and anecdotes mixed
  into the good science he presents.

  This presentation will take you through Dr. Bob’s “life story” in
  paleontology. From finding his first fossils on a canoe trip with his
  wife Mary, to authoring several published books on the topic of
  paleontology.<br><br>
  Dr. Bob is an important part of TBFC and how we operate through
  the year, so come out and see him on April 6.

        <h2>Tampa Bay Fossil Chronicles</h2><br>

        Hopefully you’ve noticed that TBFC has stepped up its game with
        the newsletter each month. In addition to all of our regular
        contributors, we’ve added two new recurring articles this season. “In
        Touch with Inverts” by Rob Carlson was added in September. Recently added, “Paleo Analysis” by Steve Vicari.
        Each month Steve will be discussing interesting prehistoric fauna and how they
        relate to extant species. <br><br>Please check out all of the articles in each
        issue. <strong>Only TBFC members</strong> receive the Chronicles, we don’t post it online or on Facebook.
