          <h1>President's Message</h1>
          <span></span>
          <strong>TBFC Finishes First Full Season Under COVID</strong><br><br>
            Well Folks, we did our best. Despite all of the cancellations that
            occurred during the 20-21 season, we were able to start making
            some baby steps forward. Sure, we all missed Fossilfest and the
            Peace River Adventure, but we did manage to get field trips back up
            and running, at least in the river. The mines all remain closed. I
            know virtual meetings aren’t the same, but if you’ll give it a try,
            you’ll find that they are entertaining (and you can watch in your
            pajamas). I have contacted USF for their decision on scheduling our
            meetings for the fall. Cross your fingers and hope for good news.
            We enjoyed a successful paleo swap meet.

            Most of us have come to realize that COVID and its grip on society
            will not be over anytime soon. TBFC will make every effort to safely
            return our activities to normal as soon reasonably possible. Bear
            with us. Hopefully my report to you in September will bring good
            news and announce more in person events.<br><br>

            <strong>TBFC Closed for Summer</strong><br><br>
            Each year TBFC takes a much deserved summer hiatus. This year, it
            seems somewhat like we’ve been on break from TBFC for the whole
            year. If you’re new to TBFC you may not know that we do shut
            down for the summer. There will be no regular monthly meetings
            held in June, July, or August.
            The 2020-2021 season comes to an end. As I have

            reported to you many times in the past, it is an honor and a
            privilege to serve and represent the Tampa Bay Fossil Club and its many

            fine members.
            I want to thank the great support staff behind me in the Officers,
            Directors, and many of you members who volunteer to help TBFC
            excel to the exceptional level it has in both the public and scientific
            communities. Without all of you, none of what TBFC accomplishes
            each season would be possible.

            See you in September, and remember...
            If you’re too busy to go fossil hunting, you’re just too busy!

            Monthly Peace River trips are over for now and will resume when the water levels go back down in the fall.

            Guest Speaker Dr. Bob Sinibaldi: Pleistocene Survivors!
            <br><br>
            7PM VIRTUAL CLUB MEETING Live on
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/tampabayfossilclub" class="links">YouTube</a>
          </strong></span>
          <p>
            When most of us think of the Ice Age, we think of glaciers, Wooly Mammoths, Saber Cats, and Dire Wolves. The hard core fossil hounds might think of Glyptodonts, Ground Sloths, and Giant Armadillos. But often overlooked are the stories of the White-Tailed Deer, the Virginia Opossum, or the American Black Bear. These along with many other common critters in Florida were the big winners of the terminal Ice Age mega-faunal extinction. Their stories are as equally, or maybe even more important, to recognize and study as they were the ones who survived the cataclysm 12,700 years ago at the end of the last Ice Age. Looking at who got through the last mass extinction event, and why they did, will be of great importance as we progress further through our current accelerated level of extinctions worldwide.
            <br><br>A TBFC favorite, Dr. Bob shares research from his upcoming book and discusses the animals that were fortunate enough to survive the last Ice Age. Few animals weighing more than a hundred pounds survived the event. Log on to this last virtual meeting of the season to find out why.

        <strong>Tampa Bay Fossil Chronicles</strong><br><br>

        Hopefully you’ve noticed that TBFC has stepped up its game with
        the newsletter each month. In addition to all of our regular
        contributors, we’ve added two new recurring articles this season. “In
        Touch with Inverts” by Rob Carlson was added in September. Recently added, “Paleo Analysis” by Steve Vicari.
        Each month Steve will be discussing interesting prehistoric fauna and how they
        relate to extant species. <br><br>Please check out all of the articles in each
        issue. <strong>Only TBFC members</strong> receive the Chronicles, we don’t post it online or on Facebook.
