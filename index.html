            TBFC Season resumes in September! <strong>Next Club Meeting: Sept. 11, 2021 @ 7pm EDT
            in the <a href="meetings.html">USF Behavioral Science Room #103</a> (In-Person)</strong>. <br>We will experiment with doing a live stream of
            the in-person meeting but no guarntee on our network connectivity or stream quality.
            <br>It will be very experimental but we will try!
            <br>

            <br> Next Monthly Peace River Trip
            <strong>Sept. 25, 2021 (River Level Permitting!!!)</strong> - Check the
            <strong><a href="fieldtrips.html">Field Trips</a></strong> page or

          <h1>President's Message</h1>
          <span></span>
          <strong>TBFC – 2021-2022 Season Begins!</strong><br><br>

          Look, I don’t want to jinx anything here. I fell for it at the last
          season opener and thought we might be “good”. Turns out it’s been
          15 months since TBFC has operated under normal (pre-COVID) conditions.
          We’ve had a few field trips and a SWAP meet, but nothing
          indoors, no meetings, no FossilFest, or Peace River Adventure.
          Even the Mini Adventure was canceled due to rising water levels.<br><br>

          TBFC’s return from our summer break is usually an exciting time,
          but I don’t have to explain to any of you how COVID has thrown
          TBFC and our country for a loop. As of this writing, we are approved
          to return to the USF campus and the Florida State Fairgrounds has
          accepted our FossilFest dates for 2022. I say all of this
          as I carefully “knock on wood”. We all know that conditions with
          COVID can change. For now though, we’ll march forward preparing
          for the 2021-2022 season. Short of any mandates from USF or the
          fairgrounds, we will attempt to get back to business as usual.<br><br>

          Staying out of the politics of COVID, I can tell you that TBFC will
          continue to act responsibly and safely. As of today, this is USF’s
          instructions regarding masks. “...we expect that all members of our
          community will wear a mask on campus, vaccinated or unvaccinated.
          This is especially important while indoors, in crowded outdoor
          settings, if you have a weakened immune system or if you have an
          underlying medical condition.” <br><br>

          I want to tell you that we appreciate all of your support for TBFC
          during the past 15 months. Most of you kept your membership up
          to date. We sold a lot of the t-shirts for FossilFest 2020, an event
          that didn’t even happen. TBFC’s Facebook page continues to do
          great with lots of activity and 3,000 members.
          Is it too early to say that TBFC survived COVID? It sure seems that
          we did, and we will continue to survive any obstacles the Quaternary
          period has to throw at us. So, in that vein, here we go again...
            <br><br>

          <strong>Field Trips</strong><br><br>
          Despite Marlin Swikert’s best efforts, all of the mines we hunt will
          remain closed to visitors through the end of 2021. On the bright
          side, Fred Hendershot predicts that all of the rains and flooding
          should make for a great fossil hunting season in the rivers when the
          water levels finally do subside. We have also added a Venice shark
          tooth dive to our field trips on October 16. If it’s successful, we’ll
          make that a regular trip on our schedule. Thanks to member Doug
          Woodring and Top 2 Bottom Charters for helping make the dive trip
          possible.<br><br>

          <strong>Please keep a watch out for any changes that COVID could cause
          with our scheduled events.</strong><br><br> Read the Chronicles each
          month (Members Only), check
          the calendar here on the TBFC website, and follow us on Facebook. Also,
          please be very cautious while venturing out into the rivers and
          creeks. At the time of this writing we are seeing flood stage
          conditions in most waterways. There’s nothing in those rivers worth
          dying for.

          </p>
            <p>
            Good Hunting! <br>

            Guest Speaker Dr. Jonathon Bloch, Curator of Vertebrate Paleontology, FLMNH: Paleocene-Eocene Fossils of Wyoming
            <br><br>
            7PM IN-PERSON CLUB MEETING at the <a href="meetings.html">USF
              Behavioral Science Room #103</a> <br>We will also try to be Live on

            not even work! But we will try!
          </strong></span>
          <p>
            Dr. Jonathan Bloch’s research involves the study of fossil mammals
            from the Paleogene (65 to 25 million years ago) in order to address
            paleoecological, phylogenetic, and biogeographic questions surrounding
            the first appearance and early evolution of Primates and

            other mammals of modern aspect.<br><br>
            The origin of primates represents the first
            clear step in the divergence of humans from
            the rest of mammals, yet our understanding

            of this important period in evolutionary history remains limited. A major emphasis is

            the interval from the terminal Cretaceous
            through the early Eocene, which includes
            the evolution and diversification of “archaic”
            mammals following the extinction of the
            dinosaurs and the first appearance of nearly
            one-half of the modern orders of mammals,
            several appearing coincident with rapid,
            large-scale, global warming at the Paleocene
            -Eocene boundary. Primary data supporting

            this research come from active paleontological fieldwork in the
            Paleocene-Eocene of the

            Clarks Fork, Bighorn, and Crazy Mountain
            basins of Wyoming and Montana, and
            northern Colombia (South America).<br><br>

            Dr. Jonathan’s peer-reviewed papers include
            anatomical descriptions and analysis of the

            first primate radiation based on remarkably complete skeletons.
            Using data from high-resolution X-ray CT imaging methods, he has

            revolutionized this field by revealing detailed aspects of the
            anatomy of the skull and evolution of the brain in fossil primates.
            Based on these studies, he has demonstrated that the fossil record of
            Primates is well represented in the Paleocene, effectively extending

            the fossil record of that group by 10 million years beyond what had
            previously been thought.<br><br>

            Dr. Jonathan’s research projects on Paleocene-Eocene mammals
            from Wyoming and Montana have been funded by four grants from

            the National Science Foundation (NSF) since 2003. With this funding,
            he is studying the response of vertebrate and plant
            communities to climate change, as well as the phylogeny, evolutionary
            morphology, and paleoecology of small mammals, especially primates

            and their relatives, using some of the most exquisitely preserved
            mammalian skulls and skeletons yet known for this time interval.

            Dr. Jonathan has also received funding to collect and study late
            Pliocene (4 million years old) mammal fossils from Florida, and another

            to work on early Miocene (20 million years old) fossils from the
            Panama Canal. Hope to see you all there!

        <strong>Tampa Bay Fossil Chronicles</strong><br><br>

        Hopefully you’ve noticed that TBFC has stepped up its game with
        the newsletter each month. In addition to all of our regular
        contributors, we’ve added two new recurring articles this season. “In
        Touch with Inverts” by Rob Carlson was added in September. Recently added, “Paleo Analysis” by Steve Vicari.
        Each month Steve will be discussing interesting prehistoric fauna and how they
        relate to extant species. <br><br>Please check out all of the articles in each
        issue. <strong>Only TBFC members</strong> receive the Chronicles, we don’t post it online or on Facebook.
