          <strong>Another Year, Come and Gone</strong><br>
            <p>
            One year ago today I was writing here about what a great
            year we had lined up for TBFC. We began reaching out to
            volunteers for FossilFest and we were announcing the great
            speakers we would have for the monthly meetings. Like everyone else,
            I had no idea that within about 90 days the entire
            year would go to heck in a handbag. We made the most of
            2020, and TBFC made it through with only some bumps and
            bruises.<br><br>
            I made a joke at the end of the December meeting that,
            “TBFC would not go quietly into the night...” And it won’t.
            We won’t allow that, and more importantly, YOU won’t allow
            that. The member’s support of TBFC has been overwhelming
            since COVID slowed us all down. Membership has done well
            throughout the virus. The online auction we held in November was
            successful and the monthly virtual monthly meetings
            have been well attended. I would estimate we have nearly as
            many people in attendance for virtual meetings as we have
            historically had in-person. Unfortunately, the simple turning
            of a calendar page to 2021 doesn’t hit a reset button for society
            vs. COVID.
            <br><br>
            As of now, the University of South Florida will not be opening
            its campus to ad-hoc events in January. That will probably
            continue through the end of the first semester in May of
            2021. While I’ve considered holding meetings outdoors, I
            have heard the voices of concern regarding any in person
            gettogethers. For now, we will play it safe and have at least one

            more virtual meeting. Getting into 2021 we will see what
            protections the vaccines provide (if any and when) and how
            our country deals with the virus in the New Year.

            For now, we are moving forward with our plans to hold FossilFest
            2021. It seems we will be able to work the show within the
            guidelines the Florida State Fair Authority has required.
            If those guidelines don’t change, maybe we can pull it off.
            In spite of ourselves, 2021, here we come! TBFC fossil hunters,
            this is our season! The water is low and the visibility is getting better
            every day. Get off the couch
            and into those rivers! We had
            several good storms this year
            to stir up the riverbeds and
            expose more fossils and fossil
            layers. Don’t think that you
            have to be a SCUBA diver to
            get in on this adventure. Some of the best fossils I’ve seen
            were found by snorkelers and screen-washers. There are fossils to
            be found!
            <br><br>
            Fred Hendershot will be running our monthly Peace River day
            trip on January 23. But don’t wait for him, get out there on
            your own. Join our Facebook page to connect with other fossil
            hunters. Organize your own group hunt or canoe trip.
            Meet at a boat ramp and walk in. I promise you that great
            fossils await, you just have to get out there and find them. Be
            safe, social distance, and take care of each other out there.
            Fossil hunting season is
            officially open in Florida! <strong>Be sure to renew your
              <a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/vertpaleo/amateur-collector/fossil-permit/" class="links">permits</a>!</strong>
            <br><br>
            Should COVID allow it, the next few months will be very busy
            for TBFC. We will schedule virtual or in person meetings each
            month. FossilFest 2021 is on the schedule, and we certainly
            hope the Peace River Adventure can run. It will take all of the
            TBFC tribe to pull it off.
            <br><br></p>
            <p>
            Good and safe hunting to you! And happy New Year too! <br>

          <strong>TBFC Returns!</strong>
          <p>Welcome back fossil hunters, it’s that time of year again! The kids
          are back to school (maybe), the dog days of summer will hopefully
          come to an end (maybe not until October), and it’s time to wake the
          Tampa Bay Fossil Club from its summer hibernation! As usual, your
          TBFC Officers and Directors have already been hard at work preparing
          for you another great season of interesting meetings, informative
          lectures, and field trip adventures, COVID allowing! Are you ready?

          <strong>Tampa Bay Fossil Chronicles</strong><br><br>

          Hopefully you’ve noticed that TBFC has stepped up its game with
          the newsletter each month. In addition to all of our regular
          contributors, we’ve added two new recurring articles this season. “In
          Touch with Inverts” by Rob Carlson was added in September. In
          this issue, “Paleo Analysis” by Steve Vicari debuts.
          Each month Steve will be discussing interesting prehistoric fauna and how they
          relate to extant species. <br><br>Please check out all of the articles in each
          issue. <strong>Only TBFC members</strong> receive the Chronicles, we don’t post it online or on Facebook.

          Vertebrate fossils collected from the Peace River and its tributaries
          in Hardee and De Soto Counties were the frequent objects of study
          by professional paleontologists between 1880 and 1928. But since
          then very few scientific publications have used Peace River specimens.
          This change was the result of discovery of Florida fossil vertebrate
          localities that greatly exceeded those then known from the
          Peace River in terms of quality and/or quantity of specimens.
          <br><br>When Florida Museum paleontologists began a systematic program
          of collecting river fossils in the 1960s, they concentrated their
          efforts in northern Florida. But thanks to many generous public
          donations, Peace River specimens in Florida Museum collections
          now exceed 2500, some belonging to species never recorded from
          the region in the scientific literature. Over the next two years, UF
          graduate student Mackenzie Ross and Florida Museum collections
          manager Richard Hulbert will lead a project based on this sample.<br><br>
          In addition to traditional paleontological research, including
          description of specimens and analyses of mammalian teeth to make
          inferences about diet and climate, the PRiPP will provide K-12
          science educators in the region with actual and virtual fossil
          specimens along with data and technical support to develop their own
          course curricula and lesson plans dealing with Peace River
          paleontology. The project will also develop multi-media content aimed at
          avocational and recreational fossil collectors, such as on-line
          identification guides, as well as in-home visits to private collections once
          these can be done safely.
