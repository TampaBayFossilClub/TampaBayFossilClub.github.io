          <h2>2025-2026 Season</h2>
          <br>
          <strong>TBFC Is Back in Action!</strong><br><br>
          Our first meeting of the 2025-26 season was huge! Month to
month we typically average about 70 people in attendance at club
meetings, but our first meeting of the season usually sees a few
more paleo lovers in attendance. September’s speaker Patty
Moore really packed them in, though. We had 125 in attendance to
see Patty’s presentation on the history and legacy of the Leisey
Shell pit fossil discoveries. We even had guests in attendance from

the Casey family, mine owners, who were instrumental in the recovery of the
Leisey fossils. I hope we can keep this momentum

going throughout the season and have a packed room at all our
meetings. Thanks Patty, it was a great presentation!<br><br>
Rain, Rain, Rain... We slipped into September thinking we’d get
lucky with the Peace River remaining huntable. That ship has sailed
though, and the Peace seems it will be too deep for screen washers

and snorkelers until these daily rains let up. There is always something
protecting the fossils.<br><br>

Some persistent SCUBA divers are getting into the rivers, but for
the most part, we’re just washed out right now. The water will go

down, eventually. If we can get through another month or so without a hurricane
maybe we can begin to pull off TBFC’s normal

monthly river events. In the meantime, check out TBFC’s limestone
quarry and Bone Valley Fossil Farm field trips.

          <p>

            When dinosaurs disappeared, mammals began to thrive and take

center stage. Prehistoric World invites readers

into this fascinating

chapter of natural history, featuring detailed

species accounts by
Aaron Woodruff, who
manages vertebrate

paleontology collections at the Florida Museum of Natural History. The book is further

enriched with vivid artwork by renowned paleoartist Julius
Csotonyi.<br><br>

Titled Prehistoric World: Over 1,200 Incredible Mammals and Discoveries from the
Mesozoic and Cenozoic, the book highlights the

rise of warm-blooded animals after the dinosaurs’ extinction. Aaron presents
engaging details about each species, covering their

diets, habitats, and behaviors, while blending scientific accuracy
with storytelling.<br><br>
Well-known Ice Age icons such as mammoths and saber-toothed

cats are included, but readers will also encounter many lesser-known species
unearthed in more recent discoveries.<br><br>

“Bear-dogs are among my favorite ancient predators,” Woodruff

explained. “Before the great cats evolved, they dominated landscapes across
the Northern Hemisphere and Africa.”<br><br>

Prehistoric World also sheds light on ancient mustelids, the ancestors of
today’s weasels, badgers, and wolverines. Unlike their modern relatives, these
carnivores could grow as large

as wolves or jaguars during the Oligocene and Miocene periods, making

them capable hunters of
deer- and horse-sized
prey.<br><br>
The artwork in Prehistoric
World will grab people’s
attention and spark their
imagination.<br><br>
Aaron devoted seven
months to researching and
writing the book, often
working nights, weekends,

and holidays while maintaining his full-time role at

the museum. He even finished Prehistoric World on his birthday.
“This is exactly the type of book that ten-year-old me would have
cherished,” Aaron recalls. As a child, he was captivated by dinosaur
books, often making his own versions by drawing creatures, writing
descriptions, and stapling the pages together.<br><br>
Some species proved challenging to document, since many were

described centuries ago with minimal context. In these cases, Aaron turned to
Greek and Latin dictionaries to decode their scientific

names. He also coined common names when none existed, for

instance, Miopanthera lorteti became “Lortet’s cat,” and Tremarctos floridanus
was given the name “Florida spectacled bear.”<br><br>

“Much of the fossil record comes down to isolated teeth,” Aaron
says. “If we’re lucky, those teeth are still attached to jaws.” Even
so, paleontologists can deduce a surprising amount of information,
such as diet, age, and sometimes sex, from these limited remains.<br><br>
Aaron says his younger self “would have been ecstatic” to know he
would one day publish a book on paleontology. Though marketed
primarily toward children, Prehistoric World is designed to appeal

to readers of all ages, offering both fresh knowledge about prehistoric mammals
and a greater respect for the diversity of life, past

and present.<br><br>
Come to the October meeting to see Aaron’s presentation and

learn more about our Prehistoric World! We’ll have plenty of copies of the
book on hand for purchase and for Aaron to sign.
