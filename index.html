          <strong>TBFC – 2021-2022 Season</strong><br><br>

          Normally TBFC takes off in a running start in September. This year
          we kind of peeked around the corner and snuck out with our tails
          between our legs. That’s okay though, with the way things have
          gone for the past 15 months, we’ll take it. We have two “in person”
          meetings under our belt and before you know it, the 2021 portion
          of TBFC’s season will be over. At the next meeting we’ll already be
          talking about FossilFest 2021 and the Peace River Adventure.
          <br><br>

          <strong>Field Trips</strong><br><br>
          TBFC’s recent Venice shark tooth dive went very well. I’d like to
          thank member Doug Woodring for arranging the whole trip and
          guiding it too with Top 2 Bottom Charters. Thanks Doug!
          <br><br>
          Despite Marlin Swikert’s best efforts, all of the mines we hunt will
          remain closed to visitors through the end of 2021. On the bright
          side, Fred Hendershot predicts that all of the rains and flooding
          should make for a great fossil hunting season in the rivers when the
          water levels finally do subside. <br><br>

          <strong>Please keep a watch out for any changes that COVID could cause
          with our scheduled events.</strong><br><br> Read the Chronicles each
          month (Members Only), check
          the calendar here on the TBFC website, and follow us on Facebook. Also,
          please be very cautious while venturing out into the rivers and
          creeks. At the time of this writing we are seeing flood stage
          conditions in most waterways. There’s nothing in those rivers worth
          dying for.
          <br><br>
          <strong>A few things for the remainder of 2021...</strong><br><br>
          We will meet in November
          for our annual auction. Attendance in the past for this event

          has been low, despite some great auction items (and good company).
          We really need the boost for scholarship revenue, so I’d like to

          invite everyone to show up for a good time. If you have auction
          items to donate, please bring them along, or contact me in advance

          if you need someone to pick them up. I’d really appreciate any
          support we can get for the auction.
          <br><br>
          There will be <strong>no meeting in December.</strong> Not necessarily by choice,
          but more of a scheduling conflict with USF. Hopefully this won’t be
          a recurring problem.

          Come January we will need to hit the ground running. Despite continuing
          challenges with COVID, FossilFest 2022 is a GO! The Peace
          River Adventure is a GO! I say both with enthusiasm... unless COVID
          shuts down the world again.<br><br>

          I hope to see lots of you at the November 6 auction!

          </p>
            <p>
            Good Hunting! <br>

          <p>
            TBFC’s November meeting will host our annual Ben Waller Memorial
            Scholarship Auction. This will be your best opportunity to pick up

            all sorts of “paleo” related goodies for your favorite fossil hunter.
            Or, what the heck, to keep for yourself! And it’s all for a good
            cause. Proceeds will help benefit the numerous scholarships TBFC
            awards throughout the year.<br><br>
            There will be lots of “paleo” items available in the auction from all
            of the generous folks who donate to this worthy cause. So, if you
            have a bunch of those pesky meg teeth laying around, or too many
            mammoth molars to fit under your bed, consider donating them to
            this excellent cause! If you don’t have any fossils you’re ready to
            part with yet, a big heart and an open wallet is all you need. What
            makes the Ben Waller Memorial Auction a success... is YOU!
            TBFC’s auctioneer extraordinaire will once again be our very own
            Dr. Bob Sinibaldi. His booming voice and silly anecdotes keep the
            auction interesting and a show not to be missed.<br><br>
            Please keep in mind that we haven’t had an auction in a long time.
            We need these funds to operate and pay scholarships to students in
            the geosciences. If you haven’t attended an auction in the past,
            please consider coming to the November meeting. Dr. Bob has
            made the auctions as funny and entertaining as they can be. If you
            attend, I promise you’ll have a good time whether you bid on any
            fossils or not.<br><br>
            We’ll have lots of great paleo-items to auction off including a good
            supply of legally collected artifacts. And... to make it easier for you
            to purchase items from TBFC’s auction and paleo store, we take
            checks, credit and debit cards, and gold doubloon!
        </p>

        <strong>Tampa Bay Fossil Chronicles</strong><br><br>

        Hopefully you’ve noticed that TBFC has stepped up its game with
        the newsletter each month. In addition to all of our regular
        contributors, we’ve added two new recurring articles this season. “In
        Touch with Inverts” by Rob Carlson was added in September. Recently added, “Paleo Analysis” by Steve Vicari.
        Each month Steve will be discussing interesting prehistoric fauna and how they
        relate to extant species. <br><br>Please check out all of the articles in each
        issue. <strong>Only TBFC members</strong> receive the Chronicles, we don’t post it online or on Facebook.
