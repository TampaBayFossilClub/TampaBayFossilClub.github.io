          <strong>
          PALEO SWAP MEET PROSPONED UNTIL MARCH 13 DUE TO RAIN </strong> <p>
We just can’t seem to catch a break.  All of the weather/news outlets are showing rain all day for tomorrow.  Although I know our vendors could cover their wares with plastic or canopies, we just won’t get any shoppers to come out to support the event if it’s raining all day.
As you all know, this is Florida, it might pour all day or just be a light sprinkle, but everyone is predicting a high chance of rain/wind through most of the day.
My apologies to any inconvenience this causes.</p>
          <strong>FossilFest 2021 Canceled</strong><br>
            <p>
            We are all disappointed, but there was no choice but to pull the
            plug. With less than two months until show time, Barbara Fite
            reports that we were only at about 33% participation from dealers.
            <br>
            Seina Searle confirmed that we only had about 25 volunteers signed
            up (including the Board members). We need 125. As much as it
            pains me to say, people just aren’t ready yet to participate in a large
            multi-day show. Please know that we all did our best to make
            FossilFest happen. We have already redirected our efforts to FossilFest
            2022 scheduled for March 19 & 20.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Paleo SWAP Meet! March 13, 2021 </strong><br><br>
            Back in the “old days” before large shows like FossilFest, a lot of
            hobby clubs held SWAP meets. It was a staple of rock and fossil
            clubs in the 70s. With the cancellation of FossilFest and COVID
            concerns, we’ve decided to give the old SWAP meet a try.
            On a much smaller scale, and, more importantly, outdoors, TBFC
            will hold what we hope to be a one-time substitute for FossilFest.
            Our plan is to host about 30 dealers in an outdoor setting where
            folks can social distance as they see fit. The Paleo SWAP meet will
            be a one day event, 9AM – 3PM. The cost for dealers is $25 per
            parking spot, entrance fee for shoppers is $2. Facemask will be
            required. If you’re not comfortable wearing a mask, please don’t
            attend.
            <br><br>
            <strong>TBFC SWAP Meet Location:</strong><br>
            American Postal Workers Union Hall, <br>
            4409 West Alva Street, Tampa, Florida 33614

            <strong>Peace River Monthly Trips </strong><br><br>
            Fred Hendershot will be running our monthly Peace River day
            trips, water levels and weather allowing. But don’t wait for him, get out there on
            your own. Join our Facebook page to connect with other fossil
            hunters. Organize your own group hunt or canoe trip.
            Meet at a boat ramp and walk in. I promise you that great
            fossils await, you just have to get out there and find them. Be
            safe, social distance, and take care of each other out there.
            Fossil hunting season is
            officially open in Florida! <strong>Be sure to renew your

            Guest Speaker Nicole Cannarozzi: Environmental Archaeology,
              Collection Manager Florida Museum of Natural History
            <br><br>
            7PM VIRTUAL CLUB MEETING Live on

            Archaeologist and collections assistant Nicole Cannarozzi was
            appointed collections manager of the Florida Museum of Natural
            History’s environmental archaeology program in 2018. She originally
            started at the Florida Museum in 2004 as a faunal analyst after graduating
            from the University of Florida with a bachelor’s degree in anthropology.
            She’s worked with the museum in various positions over the past 14
            years while completing her PhD. “The museum is one of the reasons I’ve stayed in
            Gainesville,” said Cannarozzi, who was hired into her current
            position in March 2018. “I’ve been lucky to work in one of the best
            zooarchaeology labs in the country.” Cannarozzi said she wants to
            focus on outreach, with a goal of recruiting more volunteers and
            participating in museum-sponsored and external events to expose more
            people to environmental archaeology. “I’m very happy, it’s my dream
            job,” Cannarozzi said. “I really like the integrated nature of the
            museum where you have many departments and disciplines under one
            roof. That kind of atmosphere fosters communication and
            collaboration that is so important for our research.”
            <br><br>
            The Florida Museum environmental archaeology program was established
            in 1961. Its researchers use soil and animal and plant remains from
            archaeological sites to better understand past human interactions
            with the natural environment.

        <strong>Tampa Bay Fossil Chronicles</strong><br><br>

        Hopefully you’ve noticed that TBFC has stepped up its game with
        the newsletter each month. In addition to all of our regular
        contributors, we’ve added two new recurring articles this season. “In
        Touch with Inverts” by Rob Carlson was added in September. In
        this issue, “Paleo Analysis” by Steve Vicari debuts.
        Each month Steve will be discussing interesting prehistoric fauna and how they
        relate to extant species. <br><br>Please check out all of the articles in each
        issue. <strong>Only TBFC members</strong> receive the Chronicles, we don’t post it online or on Facebook.
        </p>
