          <h1>President's Message</h1>
          <span></span>
          <h2>2022-2023 Season</h2>

          January is here. With that, the river fossil hunting season begins in
  earnest. Visibility in the rivers will continue to clear up and water
  levels should remain manageable until the summer brings back
  daily rains. I’ve seen many of you are already starting to “clean
  up” in the River. I don’t know that I’ve ever seen so many river

  fossils posted on our Facebook page. Take advantage of what hurricane
  season has stirred up in those rivers for us. You can’t find

  fossils sitting on your coach or watching football. Plan a river trip
  now!<br><br>
  January also brings the start of a very busy time of the year for
  TBFC. In addition to our regular monthly meetings and fieldtrips,

  FossilFest and the Peace River Adventure are right around the corner.
  We can run the Adventure blindfolded and one arm tied behind our backs,
  but FossilFest, that’s another animal.<br><br>

  <strong><a href="fossilfest.html" class="links">FossilFest</a></strong> - FossilFest 2023 runs March 18 – 19 (set up on March
  17). The show is big, one of the biggest amateur run shows in the
  country. It take a lot of volunteers to operate the show and some
  folks have already started working on Fossilfest 2023. Please put
  FossilFest dates in your calendar and schedule your volunteer time
  as far in advance as you can. We need to know as soon as possible
  that we have the 100+ volunteers it takes to run FossilFest.

          <!--<strong>Please keep a watch out for any changes that COVID could cause
          with our scheduled events.</strong><br><br>--> Read the Chronicles each
          month (Members Only), check
          the calendar here on the TBFC website, and follow us on Facebook. Also,
          please be very cautious while venturing out into the rivers and
          creeks. There’s nothing in those rivers worth dying for.

          </p>

            Explore the prehistoric world of elephants and their relatives the
            mastodon. What is their origin? Discover why so

            many of these beasts’ fossil bones are found in our sinkholes,
            ponds and river bottoms. How did they live, what

            were the predators that hunted them and what was their

            relationship to other prehistoric mammals? Did early humans lead
            to many of their species extinction? Dave will

            examine these strange varieties of elephant families, their
            prehistoric habits and range. Can science bring back the
            mastodon and their relatives the mammoth?<br><br>
            David Letasi has been interested in fossils and pre-historic
            times since he was eight years old and thus has had many
            years’ experience searching for fossils all over North
            America and Asia. By age twelve, he had discovered three
            archeological sites that are recorded in the Michigan State
            Archeological Site Survey. In addition to dinosaurs, Letasi
            has studied prehistoric man, ancient world history, and
            archeology.<br><br>
            After serving in the Navy, he decided to travel around the
            United States to collect specimens from well-known fossil
            sites in Wyoming, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Florida, as
            well as Canada and several countries in Asia. After he
            married his wife, Suzanne, in 1972 she began to travel

            with him. In 1976 they moved to Florida where it was possible to
            collect saber-tooth cat fossils, his main field of interest.
            Dave worked for Great Explorations Museum in St Petersburg and

            assumed a number of duties, including designing and curating
            exhibits and later worked at the Museum of Science and Industry

            (MOSI) in Tampa. While at MOSI, he led cave explorations for
            children and adults to the Dames Cave in the Withlacoochee State

            Forest, as well as fossil-collecting trips to mining sites in Polk
            County. Since retiring from MOSI in 2007, he has been active in
            projects with the Historic Hernando Preservation Society.
<br><br>
            His lengthy résumé includes being the lead archaeological project

            coordinator with the Historic Hernando County Preservation Society,
            the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and the Gulf Archaeology Research
            Institute of Gainesville. Some interesting projects he’s

            worked on include searching for the eighteenth-century capital of
            the Seminole Nation and the exploration of the Bayport Civil War
            shipwreck site.<br><br>
            If you have any mammoth or mastodon fossil material, bring it
            along to the January meeting. Dave would sure like to see it and
            so would the rest of us!

        <h2>Tampa Bay Fossil Chronicles</h2><br>

        Hopefully you’ve noticed that TBFC has stepped up its game with
        the newsletter each month. In addition to all of our regular
        contributors, we’ve added two new recurring articles this season. “In
        Touch with Inverts” by Rob Carlson was added in September. Recently added, “Paleo Analysis” by Steve Vicari.
        Each month Steve will be discussing interesting prehistoric fauna and how they
        relate to extant species. <br><br>Please check out all of the articles in each
        issue. <strong>Only TBFC members</strong> receive the Chronicles, we don’t post it online or on Facebook.
