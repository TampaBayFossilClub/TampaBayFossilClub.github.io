          <h1>President's Message</h1>
          <span></span>
          <strong>FossilFest in the works</strong><br><br>

          By the time you read this, it will be darned
          near game time. There are a lot people who have been working
          hard to make
          <a href="flyers/2022 FF Flyer.pdf" class="links">FossilFest</a> 2022
          happen. Unless you’re new to TBFC,
          you already know that COVID shut the show down for 2020 and
          2021. We lost tons of wasted man-hours preparing for those shows
          that didn’t happen. We lost $$$ too. Most of the funds we depend
          on to financially support TBFC comes from FossilFest. We’ve been
          living from our savings for two years now. I can tell you all that we
          are excited, but a little gun-shy at this point. Here’s what has to
          happen.<br><br>
          As I write this, we are about 50 volunteers short for running the
          show. What that means is, we may not be able to run every feature
          of the show that we have in the past. Our plan is to march forward
          with what we have. If at the opening of the show we only have
          enough volunteers to run the gate and support the vendors, that’s
          all we will do. If we get enough to add activities like Kids Mine, Star
          Search, and ID tables, we’ll do that. Everybody has whispered in my
          ear for a year or more that we need to get TBFC back to normal.
          Well folks, it’s time to walk the walk. We need volunteers to pull
          this off. <br><br>
          We have enough vendors at this point (we have room for more

          though). That was a problem last year and the main reason we can-
          celled. Vendors just weren’t ready to travel yet. This part of the

          equation is taken care of.
          The last part... We need customers to show up to FossilFest. In all
          honesty, we need about a thousand paying adults to come through
          the door. If we can get patrons to show up, we just might pull this
          off without taking it in the shorts.<br><br>
          So, please volunteer if you’re able. If you’re just a fossil fan and not
          ready to volunteer quite yet, please make plans to show up to the
          show. Please tell any of your friends that may have similar interests
          to visit FossilFest too. Share FossilFest on your social media. We’ve
          all been shut up in a box for two years. This is the biggest paleo
          event in the south, so let’s get it done. <br><br>I THANK YOU ALL!

          <br><br>

          <strong>Peace River Adventure</strong><br><br>
          I’m sorry to tell you all that we won’t be
          holding the Adventure this year. At least not as you’ve known it. At
          this point in time, all hands are on deck to support FossilFest, and
          as you’ve read above, we‘re hoping we can make that a success. I
          just can’t ask my Board to invest the time and resources involved to
          run the weekend camping/hunting event without knowing if people
          will even show up. FossilFest should be our litmus test to see what
          the future holds. If FossilFest comes off without a hitch, we’ll start
          making plans to get TBFC back to normal. But don’t walk out on me
          just yet...<br><br>
          Even though we won’t hold the adventure, we are going to have
          some extra field trips in lieu of the event. We will have a Peace
          River weekend hunt at Thousand Trails, a one day walk in hunt and a
          canoe trip, all on the same weekend. Check out the Field Trip page
          in this edition of the Chronicles for more info. There will be plenty

          of opportunity to hunt as a group, we just won’t be doing the din-
          ners, shirts, and auction, etc.<br><br>

          Cross your fingers this all works out. Be safe out there. <br><br>

          <strong>Please keep a watch out for any changes that COVID could cause
          with our scheduled events.</strong><br><br> Read the Chronicles each
          month (Members Only), check
          the calendar here on the TBFC website, and follow us on Facebook. Also,
          please be very cautious while venturing out into the rivers and
          creeks. There’s nothing in those rivers worth dying for.
          <br><br>

          </p>
            <p>
            Good Hunting! <br>

            but the live stream quality is not guarnteed and the stream might
            not even work! But we will try! (Note: some speakers may not want to be filmed).
            At the very least we will try to get a recording uploaded after the meeting.
          </strong></span>

          On the UF Faculty since 1977, Dr. MacFadden is currently a
          distinguished professor at the Florida Museum of Natural History (FMNH)

          at the University of Florida in Gainesville. He received his
          bachelor’s degree from Cornell University and his Ph.D. in geology from

          Columbia University, with a specialization in paleontology.<br><br>
          Dr. Bruce has been a mainstay in Florida paleontology going on 50
          years now. He has been involved with most of the initiatives
          prompting Florida paleontology from the fieldwork, all the way over

          to the financing side. Many of the programs, exhibits, and discoveries
          in Florida are due to Dr. Bruce’s continued good work. <br><br>

          He is the author of 200 peer-reviewed scientific articles and 1992

          book on Fossil Horses (Cambridge) and has been principal investigator
          on more than 50 external grants, mostly from the National Science
          Foundation totaling nearly $40 million. In 2009-2010 he was a

          Program Officer in the Education Directorate at NSF and in 2015-

          2016 was a Visiting Scientist at the Santa Cruz County Office of
          Education in California. <br><br>

          Many fossil clubs and societies communicate knowledge and enthusiasm
          about fossils for the benefit of K-12 schools. Over the past

          decade the Florida Museum has undertaken several innovative projects
          that bring fossils and scientists into Florida schools for teaching
          and learning. Dr. Bruce will be discussing these initiatives,
          including the "Scientist in Every Florida School" program. This will

          include a video, PowerPoint presentation, and discussion. And as

          always, Dr. Bruce will bring updates from the museum and collections.
          I hope to see all of you at the March meeting.

        <strong>Tampa Bay Fossil Chronicles</strong><br><br>

        Hopefully you’ve noticed that TBFC has stepped up its game with
        the newsletter each month. In addition to all of our regular
        contributors, we’ve added two new recurring articles this season. “In
        Touch with Inverts” by Rob Carlson was added in September. Recently added, “Paleo Analysis” by Steve Vicari.
        Each month Steve will be discussing interesting prehistoric fauna and how they
        relate to extant species. <br><br>Please check out all of the articles in each
        issue. <strong>Only TBFC members</strong> receive the Chronicles, we don’t post it online or on Facebook.
