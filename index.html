          <h2>2024-2025 Season</h2>
          <br>
          <strong>People “DIG” FossilFest! (Pun Intended)</strong>

          <br><br>


What a weekend. Once again, what a successful show! I couldn’t
be more pleased with the results. FossilFest had good coverage on
both television and social media, and it sure brought in a great
crowd. Boy, it was hot though, mid 80’s on both days. Our air
conditioning bill was through the roof.<br><br>

We have three major goals each year at FossilFest; earn funds to
operate TBFC through the year, teach the public about Florida’s
prehistory, and reach out to new members. We accomplished all of

that! It looks like we had about 40 new families sign up as members with TBFC
at FossilFest and over 45 membership renewals during the month of March.
That in itself is a great success! If you’re

one of those new members that signed up for the adventure,
welcome to the Tampa Bay Fossil Club!<br><br>

We appreciate the Florida Museum of Natural History setting up
shop to issue new and renewal Fossil Hunting Permits. Rachael
Narducci reports that she received 68 new permit applications and
processed over a hundred renewals.<br><br>
Everyone worked very hard, some for three hours, some for three
days (some for weeks and months leading up to the show). I hate
to thank individual volunteers by name in this writing, but I have to
mention a few people here. TBFC Director David Faucher spent the
night on the FossilFest floor both Friday and Saturday night to stand
sentinel on the fossils at the show. David came on Friday and never
left the fossil hall until Sunday evening!<br><br>

I must thank my wife Seina for working on the volunteer assignments
for months ahead of the show, and many of the other details

at FossilFest that just seem to “happen” because of her. If it wasn’t
for Seina, FossilFest might not be able to happen as we know it.
Every year for as long as I can remember Barbara Fite has worked
on scheduling the vendors and taking care of many other aspects of

FossilFest. Barbara also handles many other problems as they occur before
and during the three-day event. She spent many hours

leading up to the show arranging and rearranging the floor plan to
fit our show’s needs, and sometimes the last-minute changes that
must happen. Our FossilFest trailer is 20 feet long and weighs in
excess of 6 tons. We need a huge truck to make that move and
someone capable of towing that much weight. For many years
Mike Burnett (and his wife Jessica) have driven from Bradenton,
Florida to pick up the trailer in Zephyrhills where it is stored on the
property of TBFC members Darren and Nicole Watts. By the time
Mike drives to Zephyrhills, hooks up, drives back to the fairgrounds,
and then back home to Bradenton, it’s an eight-hour day (nearly
300 miles for the weekend). He does this on Friday, in morning
traffic, and then again on Sunday afternoon. Hidden in all of the
excitement of FossilFest is Bill Faucher collecting money, making

change, and getting cash money safely to the bank. Dr. Bob Sinibaldi and
Rachael Cronin assisted me with television appearances and

Dr. Bob did two lecture presentations each day at FossilFest. Dr.

Leslie Branin hauled a metric ton of books to the show. Fred Hendershot and the
crew spent the entire weekend with kids at the

Touch Table. Also working with the kids at the Sand Mine was Pat
Appledorn for the entire weekend. It takes a bunch of patience to
deal with all of the excitement in the kid’s area. Marlin Swikert
runs the Silent auction all weekend like a well-oiled machine. Mike

Barnes cooked a
lot of hot dogs
over the weekend

for both volunteers and vendors.

He tells me he
can’t eat hot dogs
himself anymore.
And that’s just
some of the big
things that get
done... I am so

sorry I can’t mention everyone

here in this
writing.<br><br>
Our furthest traveling volunteer for FossilFest? To my knowledge,
it’s John Campbell who travels from Boston, Massachusetts each
year to spend the entire weekend with us.<br><br>
Again, I hate to mention individuals here because I know I’ll forget
somebody who did an above the “call of duty” job and there were
too many people to name that spent three entire days at FossilFest.<br><br>
I have to thank TBFC’s Officers, Directors, and ALL of the volunteers
who made the show the success that it was. We certainly couldn’t

have done it without you. If you were one of the 130 plus volunteers during the
show, thank you. From the admissions, to the silent auction,
donations, club sales, kids mine, set up, break down,

security, and everything in-between, I can’t thank you all enough.<br><br>
I receive lots of accolades and slaps on the back during FossilFest. I

want you all to know that I always tell everyone what a great support staff I,
and FossilFest, have. FossilFest 2025 was a huge success, and that’s because
of <strong>all</strong> of you.<br><br>

So, I must ask... still tired from FossilFest? Sorry, no time to sit
down; TBFC’s season isn’t over yet. We’re just getting started!<br><br>

<strong>Peace River Field Trips - April 12, 2025</strong>
<br><br>

The Peace River Adventure has turned into one of TBFC’s most popular outings.
Years ago, we worried if we’d get enough participation to

make the annual event even worth the work. But some years we
worried if we would be able to accommodate everyone who wanted

to attend. That was before COVID though, and hurricanes, toxic algae blooms,
and winter/spring rains, etc.<br><br>

We hoped that we would be able to run the entire weekend event in

2025. However, it appears that the infrastructure of the area continues to be
damaged by annual hurricanes. At the time of this writing

the measurement at Zolfo Springs is nearly perfect (we need it at 6

feet, or below to hold a safe hunt). While we cannot plan a fullblown Peace
River Adventure, we will run our annual canoe trip.

The new folks we signed up at FossilFest will be biting at the bit to
get out and hunt some fossils and we will be ready for them on April
12. Check out the Field Trips page in this edition of the Chronicles for
details.<br><br>

          <!--<strong>Please keep a watch out for any changes that COVID could cause
          with our scheduled events.</strong><br><br>-->

          Read the Chronicles each
          month (Members Only), check
          the calendar here on the TBFC website, and follow us on Facebook. Also,
          please be very cautious while venturing out into the rivers and
          creeks. There’s nothing in those rivers worth dying for.<br><br>

          <p>
If there’s a hole in the ground in Florida with scientifically significant
fossils to be found, you can bet Dr. Richard Hulbert knows

about it. As the Collections Manager at the Florida Museum of Natural History
from 2000 to 2022 Dr. Richard oversaw Florida’s vertebrate fossil treasures.
Museum officials would say Dr. Richard’s

specialty was exploration, curation, organization, and preservation.
And they’d be correct. But one of Dr. Richard’s greatest skills that

some of you may not know about is his genuine interest in befriending the
amateur fossil hunter. He has the ability to convey

the importance of scientifically significant fossils to the random guy

in a canoe, ranchers and farmers, and all the way up to county governments and
the State of Florida. Dr. Richard is one of the most

important reasons the Florida Fossil Permit system is as successful
as it has been. His true love of Florida’s prehistory doesn’t hurt
either.<br><br>

Between 2015 and 2024 Florida Museum paleontologists and volunteers excavated
the skeletal remains of 47 megaherbivores from an

area of 525 square meters at the Montbrook fossil site near Ocala in
northcentral Florida. Megaherbivores are terrestrial species whose

adult mass averages 1000 kg (one metric ton) or more. The Montbrook
megaherbivores consist of two kinds of proboscideans

(elephant relatives), the gomphothere Rhynchotherium (35 skeletons) and the
mastodon Mammut (4 skeletons), and the rhino Teleoceras (8 skeletons).
Excavations at the site are continuing, so these

numbers will increase. These animals were part of a vibrant ecosystem that
existed in north Florida about 6 million years ago. As vertebrate paleontology
collections manager at the Florida Museum, Hulbert oversaw the Montbrook
excavations from 2015 until his

retirement in late 2022. His presentation at the February meeting
will focus on the three Montbrook megaherbivores and how Florida
Museum paleontologists try to determine which species are present
at the site, what was the cause or causes of their deaths and why so
many of their skeletons are present in such a relatively small area,

slightly larger than a standard basketball court.<br><br>
If you have any hard to identify Florida fossils, or potential donations
you’d like to make to the Florida Museum of Natural History, bring
them to the April meeting.
