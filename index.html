          <h2>2023-2024 Season</h2>
          <br>
          <strong>Tampa Bay Fossil Club</strong><br><br>
          This is CRUNCH time. In the next 90 days TBFC has a lot to prepare
  for and a lot of hard work too. FossilFest 2024 is just weeks away
  and the Peace River Adventure (in some format) is just a short time
  after that. We’ll also squeeze in a few more TBFC meetings, add in
  some more field trips, and throw in a big season ending dinner in
  June. Are you ready TBFC!<br><br>

          <strong>Peace River Adventure (Maybe) - April 27, 2024</strong>
  The Peace River Adventure had

  turned into one of TBFC’s most popular annual outings. Years ago, we

  worried if we’d get enough participation to make the event even worth

  the work. Turns out we ended up
  worrying if we could accommodate
  everyone who wanted to attend. Let
  me add here, that was before COVID,
  hurricanes and man-eating bacteria blooms. We haven’t held the
  full event since 2019.
  I’m including this info here because so many people have asked me
  if we will run the event in 2024, the worthless answer is, I just don’t
  know... When I checked the Peace River levels this morning, they
  were approaching 9 feet. Safe hunting conditions occur at 6 feet or
  less.<br><br>

  As Florida seems to be experiencing winter El Niño like rains, a decision to
  hold the Peace River Adventure (or a Mini Adventure) will
  have to wait until April. I’m hopeful,
  and we will do everything we can to get this event back online.<br><br>

          (set up on March 15). The show is big, one of the biggest amateur
          run shows in the country. It takes a lot of volunteers to operate FossilFest and some folks have already started
          working on Fossilfest 2024. <br><br>

          dates in your calendar and schedule your volunteer time as far in

            Dr. Bruce MacFadden started his career in Flori-
  da, joining the University of Florida faculty in

  1977. Dr. Bruce is the author of several books

  and more than 200

  peer-reviewed professional articles.

  He has been a principal investigator

  on more than 50 external grants, mostly from the National Science

  Foundation, totaling more than $35

  million. A vertebrate paleontologist by training (Cornell and Columbia),
  specializing in fossil mammals, he has been the President of

  both the Paleontological Society and Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.
  Dr. Bruce teaches courses on vertebrate paleontology and

  broader impacts of science on society and has been the major professor
  of two dozen UF graduate students. Dr. Bruce has been a

  friend to the amateur paleontology community and has made dozens of
  trips from Gainesville to Tampa over the 47 years of his time

  in Florida paleontology.<br><br>
  Each year the Florida Museum of Natural History takes students
  and teachers to learn about and hunt Oligocene fossils in the

  Badlands of Nebraska. It’s quite the trip and Dr. Bruce has participated i
  n these adventures for many years. We look forward to

  hearing his stories from the Badlands.

        <h2>Tampa Bay Fossil Chronicles</h2><br>

        Hopefully you’ve noticed that TBFC has stepped up its game with
        the newsletter each month. In addition to all of our regular
        contributors, we’ve added two new recurring articles this season. “In
        Touch with Inverts” by Rob Carlson was added in September. Recently added, “Paleo Analysis” by Steve Vicari.
        Each month Steve will be discussing interesting prehistoric fauna and how they
        relate to extant species. <br><br>Please check out all of the articles in each
        issue. <strong>Only TBFC members</strong> receive the Chronicles, we don’t post it online or on Facebook.
