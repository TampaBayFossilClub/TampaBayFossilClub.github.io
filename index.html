          <span></span>
          <h2>2024-2025 Season</h2>
          <br>
          <strong>TBFC Returns!</strong>

          <br><br>Welcome back fossil hunters, it’s that time of year
again! The kids are going back to school, the dog days of summer
will hopefully come to an end in a month or so, and it’s time to
wake the Tampa Bay Fossil Club from its summer hibernation! As
usual, your TBFC Officers and Directors have already been hard at
work preparing for you yet another great season of interesting
meetings, informative lectures, and as many field trip adventures as
we can! Are you ready TBFC?
TBFC’s return from our summer break is an exciting time for us all.
Short of any worldwide viruses, devastating hurricanes, or green
slime outbreaks, all normal activities are being prepared for in
TBFC’s 2024-2025 season. I want to tell you that we appreciate all
your support for TBFC during these past few years with all the cancellations
and last-minute adjustments we’ve had to make.<br><br>

<strong>Hurricane Debby</strong> didn’t bring much in damaging winds, but it did
dump an enormous amount of rainfall from one end of Florida to
the other. While TBFC’s mine trips will probably be unaffected, we
will have to keep an eye on water levels as we look forward to
Peace River day trips. Don’t be discouraged by the flooded rivers
though. These flooding rains do a great job at stirring up the
bottom of the rivers and exposing new fossil hunting sites for all of
us to find. When it is safe to get in the water, I’m sure we are going
to find lots of great specimens.<br><br>
BUT you are not going to find many fossils sitting on the couch.
Start making plans to join TBFC on field trips. Hook up with other
fossil enthusiasts on TBFC’s Facebook page to get out and do some
hunting. Use this downtime with the rivers being flooded to sign up
for a SCUBA class or start shopping for a new canoe or kayak.
<br><br>
In this edition’s “What TBFC Members are Finding” you’ll find a
special section for TBFC Director Joe Branin. Joe is a shining example
of what you can find when you take the time to go out and hunt
for fossils. The fossils included in this issue are just a few of the
specimens he has found since June. Many specimens important
enough to science have already been donated to the Florida Museum of Natural
History. I know some of us just can’t get out hunting
as much as Joe, but if you plan and make the time in your schedule,
you will find great fossils.

That’s how it’s done; no top-secret spots, or special clique of buddies.
Like Joe, you just need to go. When the waters levels go
down, be ready!

          <br><br>

          (set up on March 15). The show is big, one of the biggest amateur
          run shows in the country. It takes a lot of volunteers to operate FossilFest and some folks have already started
          working on Fossilfest 2024. <br><br>

          <strong>Happy Retirement, Dr. Bruce MacFadden</strong><br><br>
          I want to say congratulations and good luck

to retiring Distinguished Professor and Curator of Vertebrate Paleontology,
Dr. Bruce MacFadden. Dr. Bruce came to the University
of Florida/Florida Museum of Natural History in 1977 and has spent
most of his working life in Florida paleontology.<br><br>
He is the author of countless books and peer reviewed articles.
Grant money drives science and Dr. Bruce has been successful in
procuring nearly 50 grants totaling almost $40 million to be used in

scientific research. Just as important to us, the amateur paleontologists,
he has been a good friend. Please see the article on Dr.
Bruce MacFadden in this issue of the Chronicles.
<br><br>
          <strong>Rest in Peace, Dr. Barbara Purdy</strong><br><br>

          In closing, I must acknowledge the recent
passing of Dr. Barbara Purdy. Dr. Purdy was
a good friend to citizen scientists and always
believed we deserved a place in archaeology
where amateurs haven’t been as accepted
as on the paleontology side. Dr. Purdy presented for
TBFC on many occasions, well
into her 80s. Dr. Purdy shattered glass ceilings in archaeology
being one of the first women to be accepted in what was a male
dominated science, consequently opening
doors for countless ladies who have followed in her footsteps.
We will always miss her.<br><br>

<strong>Important Dates</strong>
TBFC’s season starts off with our first field trip on September 4,
meeting on September 7 and takes off running. There are currently
over 40 paleo activities to keep you busy between now and May of
2025, so get out there and enjoy TBFC’s paleo community!
A list of all the paleo dates for this season can be found in the September issue of the Chronicles!
Upcoming dates for field trips and other events will be added to the website monthly.
<br><br>
I look forward to seeing all of you at the meetings this season.

          <p>
  Mitchell Reigler has been interested in paleontology from a very
  young age. He attended the University of Texas at Austin with one

  goal in mind: to become a professor in paleontology. While in Austin,
  Mitchell developed an interest in the reptile fossil record almost
  immediately, leading him to pursue a Masters’ degree at Virginia Tech.
  Mitchell’s interests expanded while in Virginia to include
  systematic paleo, isotopic geochemistry, and paleoecology. His

  project on lizard response to the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum has led
  him to his current institution, the University of Florida,

  to pursue a PhD. At UF, Mitchell has worked on projects looking at
  fossil porcupines, fossil alligators, and as always, fossil lizards.
  <br><br>
  There are several new species to be discussed, and Mitchell would
  love people to bring anything they have that might be related to his

  presentation! He will be discussing a few “Wanted” fossils that the

  museum desires and is hoping somebody might have already collected and needed
  specimens that can be studied. So, if you have

  any Florida reptile fossils you would like to show off, or share with
  the Florida Museum of Natural History, bring them along.

        <h2>Tampa Bay Fossil Chronicles</h2><br>

        Hopefully you’ve noticed that TBFC has stepped up its game with
        the newsletter each month. In addition to all of our regular
        contributors, we’ve added two new recurring articles this season. “In
        Touch with Inverts” by Rob Carlson was added in September. Recently added, “Paleo Analysis” by Steve Vicari.
        Each month Steve will be discussing interesting prehistoric fauna and how they
        relate to extant species. <br><br>Please check out all of the articles in each
        issue. <strong>Only TBFC members</strong> receive the Chronicles, we don’t post it online or on Facebook.
