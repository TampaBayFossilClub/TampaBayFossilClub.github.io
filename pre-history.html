          <h1>The Pre-History of Florida</h1>
          <p>
            Relatively little is known about the history of Florida during the
            Paleozoic Era (550-225 million years ago). Most geologists agree
            that Florida, along with the rest of the southeastern United States
            and Mexico, were part of the super-continent of Gondwana. Gondwana
            included Africa, South America, Australia and Antarctica along with
            parts of Europe and Asia. At the same time, North America, Europe
            and Asia were combined into another super-continent called Laurasia.
            About 300 million years ago these two land masses collided forming
            one great super-continent called Pangea. Florida was in the middle
            of this huge landmass, thousands of miles from any ocean.
            <br><br>
            In the early Mesozoic Era, during the Triassic Period (225-190
            million years ago) Pangea began to break apart through a process
            called rifting. Rifting stretches continental crust until it breaks,
            and causes earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. As Pangea separated,
            rifting began in a northeast-southwest line running from Charleston,
            South Carolina through Savannah, Georgia to an area near the
            Apalachicola river in the Florida panhandle. If rifting had
            continued in this area, then most of Florida and part of Georgia
            would have separated from North America along with South America
            and Africa. In the early Jurassic Period however, rifting shifted
            to an area east of the Bahamas and stopped in Georgia and the
            Florida panhandle. By about 175 million years ago the newly opened
            Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico were between Florida and the
            other continents. Throughout the Triassic, Jurassic and even into
            the early Cretaceous Periods, about 125 million years ago, much of
            northern Florida remained above sea level and probably would have
            been inhabited by dinosaurs, however, no dinosaurs fossils have
            been found since the rocks that would contain them are deeply buried
            beneath younger deposits. Rising sea levels during the Jurassic
            would have submerged the southern part of Florida by midway through
            the period and by the mid-Cretaceous, Florida, along with the
            southern half of Georgia and Alabama, were underwater.
            <br><br>
            For nearly the next 100 million years Florida remained submerged.
            In the Oligocene Epoch about 30 million years ago, when global
            cooling caused sea levels to fall, northern Florida emerged from
            the sea. The oldest known fossils of terrestrial vertebrates were
            found near Gainesville and date from this time. Later in the
            Oligocene sea levels rose and Florida was submerged once again.
            Sea levels fluctuated considerably over the next 24 million years
            and at times of higher sea level, much, if not all, of Florida was
            submerged. At other times the sea was close to modern levels and
            parts of the northern peninsula and panhandle were emergent. During
            the Miocene Epoch (26-5 million years ago) the South American plate
            was again drifting north, slowly uplifting the southern peninsula.
            This, along with sands and clays eroded from the Piedmont highlands
            of central Georgia and Alabama, created what is now south and
            central Florida. By the Pliocene, North and South America were
            joined by the Panamanian Isthmus, disrupting ocean currents and
            causing widespread continental glaciation to begin. The last major
            sea level high stand was 4.5 to 2.5 million years ago, when Florida
            was submerged for the last time in geologic history.
            <br><br>
            The next 2.5 million years are know as the Ice Age. Continental
            glaciers had advanced and retreated many times from the poles, at
            times covering all of Canada and the northern United States. Ice
            piling up on the continents caused sea levels to fall as much as
            400 feet. Florida, in these times of glaciation, had a climate
            similar to that of Virginia today, with annual snowfall. With lower
            sea levels, Florida was more than twice as wide as it is today. St.
            Petersburg would have been more than 75 miles from the Gulf of
            Mexico during this time. What is now Tampa Bay, and far beyond,
            would have been a combination of palmetto landscape, grassy plains
            and woodlands, dotted with lakes and crossed by winding rivers.
            For animals seeking refuge from the bitter cold of the north,
            Florida was a welcomed haven. Between times of glaciation, the sea
            level and climate were close to that of today. During this time
            Florida’s wildlife would have included: antelope, bears, bison,
            deer, gi ant beavers, giant armadillos, ground sloths, glyptodonts,
            horses, lions, llamas, mammoths, mastodons, peccaries, saber-tooth
            cats, tapirs, wolves, alligators, crocodiles, and many others.
            <br><br>
            Man first inhabited Florida during the last period of glaciation,
            about 10 to 15 thousand years ago. Many Paleo-Indian artifacts have
            been found in Florida. These Florida natives developed several
            sophisticated cultures and thrived up until about 500 years ago
            when the Spanish explorers arrived. None of these native peoples or
            their cultures survived this encounter. In the last 12,000 years
            there has been a mass extinction of many of the megafauna (large
            vertebrate animals weighing more than 100lbs) not only in Florida,
            but throughout North America and in some cases, worldwide. There
            are several schools of thought on the cause(s) for these
            extinctions. One opinion is that these animals were unable to
            adapt to the climate changes at the end of the last glaciation
            period and subsequent changes in vegetation. Another opinion is
            that proficient human “big-game” hunters caused the animal
            populations to drop below a sustainable level. Some believe it was
            a combination of th e two, while others think disease played a
            role. We may never know the answer to this mystery, but surely the
            world is a poorer place with their loss.

            The Tampa Bay Fossil Club invites you to join us in our quest for
            knowledge of the pre-history of Florida. Join us on field trips as
            we hunt for the fossils from the long lost creatures that once
            inhabited our area. Meet with us monthly as we discuss and ponder
            the mysteries that pre-historic Florida poses.
