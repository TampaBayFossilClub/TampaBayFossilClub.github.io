          <h1>Field Trips</h1>
          <p><strong>Monthly Peace River field trips:</strong> <br>
            This season monthly peace river field trips will be on the second
            Saturday of each month in October and November, (no scheduled
              trip in December) river depth
              permitting, (below 7 feet as
              given by the “Peace River level
              at Zolfo Springs Florida”). Updates will be provided for 2023 dates.
              <br><br>We will meet
              at the <strong>Peace River Park, 1322 E.
              Main St., Wauchula.</strong> <br><br>Area A on
              the <a class="links" href="docs/PeaceRiverPark_Labels.pdf">map</a>, is about a 1⁄2 mile long
              and is deeper and not hunt-able
              if river levels are above 5 feet.
              Areas B and C are shallow and
              can be hunted by youngsters if the level is below 7 feet on the gage.
              There is a nice wide path from this park along the river to areas B
              and C, a little over 1⁄2 mile walk. Only Area C has room for a wagon. At
              this time neither site has facilities, so stop before arriving.

            <strong>Caspersen Beach Day - Feb. 29, 2022:</strong><br>
          On February 26 let’s meet at Caspersen Beach near Venice for a
          day of screening and snorkeling. I will arrive by 9AM. Bring
          along your Florida snow shovels and screens. Snorkeling the
          shallows is always fun and productive. Bring your chairs and
          coolers, drinks, and even a grill if you want to make a whole day
          of it. Caspersen Beach has showers and restrooms available.
          Keep in mind that it is difficult to predict the weather. As you all
          know, it could be 80° or 40° in February.<br><br>
          Caspersen Beach, 4100 Harbor Drive S., Venice, FL 34285<br><br>
          Get out there and hunt those rivers for fossils. Take advantage
          of the cool weather and look forward to the receding water levels
          winter will surely bring. Post your fossil finds on our Facebook page
          so we can all enjoy in your discoveries!

            <br><br>
            <strong>Peace River Park NEW LOCATION for Fall 2022 River Trips!</strong> <br>

            <br>Peace River Park at <strong>1322 Main Street East, Wauchula, FL 33873</strong>.<br><br>

            This site has a variety of hunting levels which can be seen on this <a class="links" href="docs/PeaceRiverPark_Labels.pdf">PDF Map</a>, A is deeper and for adults,
            B is very shallow and sometimes dry, C is shallow and easy to reach with a wagon if desired.

            After parking, walk across the small wooden bridge then turn sharp
            left as the path follows a small creek to the river. This is a
            primitive camping site and has no restrooms or change sites. It is
            a bit of a hike around to C but the path is mowed and easy walking.<br><br>
            You may also reach this site by kayak from the Wauchula Riverside Park Boat Ramp heading south.
            <br><br>
            The river level needs to be 7 feet or lower, as read at the Zolfo Springs gage for good/safe fossil hunting.

            <br><br>
            <strong>Brownville Park</strong>
            Typically, Peace River trips were at Brownville Park but that spot
            hasn't been producing so the new location mentioned above will be
            where the club goes starting in Fall 2022.
            The Brownville information will remain here for those that want to try it.
            <br><br> The GPS address is 1885 NE Brownville St.,
            Arcadia, FL, 34266. <br><br>There is a $2.00 per car fee payable in the box
            at left as you enter the gate. Bring correct change. <br>
            The park has reopened their campground and restrooms after being closed
            for a year due to COVID.

            <br><br>
            <strong>Please follow these simple rules so that we maintain our welcome at Brownville:</strong><br><br>

            - Please car pool to the park when you can. Parking is limited and
            has been a problem in the past. <br>
            - Please use the hose outside to rinse fossils. Some hunters have
            done this in the restroom sink and clogged them. <br>
            - The showers are for campers only. <br>
            - Please help keep trash picked up and haul your own trash when possible.
            <br><br>

            <strong> Thousand Trails </strong>
            For those folks who
            like to camp and hunt at Thousand Trails in Wauchula, I was by
            there this summer on my kayak and noted they have had sever
            bank damage and the fossil beds have been swept clean down to
            bedrock by recent floods.<br><br>

            Please watch this page, the calendar and Facebook for cancellations
            due to high water. It is not unusual for TBFC to cancel river trips
            in the spring or fall due to high water levels. - FRED </p>

          <p> <strong>Below is general information, pre-COVID-19: </strong><br>
          Check out the Events Calender for upcoming field trip dates.
          The club has two field trips almost every month except the summer months
          when the club is closed. We go to the Vulcan limestone mine north of
          Brooksville on the second Saturday of the month to collect fossil sand
          dollars. We go to the Peace River, mostly on the fourth Saturday of the
          month, to collect shark teeth and mammal fossils.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Vulcan Field Trips:</strong><br>
          To reach Vulcan (16313 Ponce De Leon Blvd., Brooksville, FL 34613),
          take I-75 north to Exit 301, Brooksville/ Rt 98. Go ten miles to
          Brooksville and follow the signs for Rt. 98 north. Go another ten miles
          north of Brooksville on 98 and watch for the CEMEX/Vulcan signs on the
          left side. Wait by the highway entrance. We go in at 9:00 AM, so don't
          be late.

          Here is some information about fossils we commonly find on our trips to
          Vulcan. (as an <a href="img/VulcanFossils.png" class="links">image</a>
          or as a <a href="docs/VulcanFossilsByRusselBrown.pdf" class="links">PDF</a>).
          <br><br>Here's some <a href="echinoids.html" class="links">info on echinoids</a> which
          are a very common find at Vulcan.
          <br><br>
          <strong>The Peace River:</strong><br>
          Open to everyone.
          Here is some information about
          <a href="fossilequipment.html" class="links">Recommended Tools</a>
          for screening in Florida rivers. Below is more information about
          locations to fossil hunt along the Peace River and other Florida
          locations.
          <br><br>

          <strong>Arcadia/Brownville:</strong><br>
          The water level for the Peace River - Arcadia Florida can be
          monitored via the US Geological Survey as seen below:<br>
          <img class="usgs-waterlevels"
            src="https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwisweb/graph?agency_cd=USGS&site_no=02296750&parm_cd=00065&period=7">
          <br><br>
          If the water level is lower than 3.5 feet in this graph, you can hunt fossils using the
          shovel and screen method in the shallows. There are several places to
          put in and just walk; boats are not needed.<br><br>
          We have started doing our monthly hunts at Brownville Park.
          The site is 6.3 miles north of Arcadia on Brownville Rd which goes out to a
          county Park on the river. Park at the boat ramp and walk upstream to
          the island and hunt the shallows. Yes, it is free. Check the calendar for trip updates.
          <br><br>
          Another location in that area is the Peace River Camp
          Ground at Arcadia, ask at the desk, when you check in and pay for a
          $15.00 pass that covers 2 days, for the wilderness area beach.
          <br><br>

          <strong>Zolfo Springs:</strong><br>
          The water level for the Peace River - Zolfo Springs Florida can be
          monitored via the US Geological Survey as seen below:<br>
          <img class="usgs-waterlevels"
            src="https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwisweb/graph?agency_cd=USGS&site_no=02295637&parm_cd=00065&period=7">
          <br><br>
          The water gage at Zolfo is in a deep hole and does not indicate
          hunting levels at Thousand Trails.
          <br> Typically, if it is 6.5 feet or lower there will be good fossil hunting in the shallows.<br><br>
          Folks who like to camp will enjoy Thousand Trails RV Park located at:
          <br>
          255 HWY 17 South, Wauchula, FL 33873
          <br><br>
          They border a long stretch of the Peace River.
          You must be a camper to hunt from their property. Screens and shovels
          are the recommended tools for fossil hunting from this location.

          <br><br>
          <strong>Gainesville Area:</strong><br>
          If you are in the Gainesville area you can try Hog Creek, and while
          there, don't miss the Florida Museum of Natural History at the
          University, it is first rate.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Venice Beach:</strong><br>
          There are some beach spots. South of Venice at the end of Harbor Drive
          is a park called Caspersen Beach with good beach hunting. Englewood
          and north to Manasota Key is OK, but the shark teeth tend to be pretty
          worn by the waves. It is nice to sit at the waters edge and pick out
          little teeth or use a screen. If you are a certified SCUBA diver, diving from
          shore from Caspersen or Venice Beach may lead to larger teeth. There
          are also a handful of dive charters in the area that can put you on
          fossil rich spots with depths up to 30ft. If you are lucky, you may
          find a Megalodon tooth!
