            <h2>Monthly Peace River Trips:</h2><br>
            Monthly Peace River field trips in the
            2024-2025 season will be on the second Saturday
            of each month until June, water levels and weather permitting.<br>
              <h3>Meeting Location:</h3> We will meet
              at the <strong>Peace River Park, 1322 E.
              Main St., Wauchula.</strong> <br><br>Area A on
              the <a class="links" href="docs/PeaceRiverPark_Labels.pdf">map</a>, is about a 1⁄2 mile long
              and is deeper and not hunt-able
              if river levels are above 5 feet.
              Areas B and C are shallow and
              can be hunted by youngsters if the level is below 7 feet on the gage.
              There is a nice wide path from this park along the river to areas B
              and C, a little over 1⁄2 mile walk. Only Area C has room for a wagon. At
              this time neither site has facilities, so stop before arriving.<br><br>
              <strong> You must be a paid member of TBFC to participate in Monthly Peace River Trips</strong>
              <br><br>
              Please watch this page, the calendar and Facebook for cancellations
              due to high water. It is not unusual for TBFC to cancel river trips
              in the spring or fall due to high water levels. <br>- FRED
              <br>
              <h3>Equipment:</h3>
              Here is some information about
              <a href="fossilequipment.html" class="links">Recommended Tools</a>
              for screening in Florida rivers. If you don't have a screen, you can typically rent one from Fred.


              <h3>Peace River Water Levels:</h3>
                Monthly Peace River trips are river depth permitting, (below 7 feet as measured
                by the Peace River gauge at <a href="#section1" class="links"> Zolfo
                Springs</a>, Florida.<br><br>

                <div id="section1"><strong>Zolfo Springs:</strong></div><br>
                The water level for the Peace River - Zolfo Springs Florida can be
                monitored via the US Geological Survey as seen below:<br>
                <img class="usgs-waterlevels"
                  src="https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwisweb/graph?agency_cd=USGS&site_no=02295637&parm_cd=00065&period=7">
                <br><br>
                The water gage at Zolfo is in a deep hole and does not indicate
                hunting levels at Thousand Trails.
                <br> Typically, if it is 7 feet or lower there will be good fossil hunting in the shallows.
                <br><br>

                <div id="section2"><strong>Arcadia/Brownville:</strong></div><br>
                The water level for the Peace River - Arcadia Florida can be
                monitored via the US Geological Survey as seen below:<br>
                <img class="usgs-waterlevels"
                  src="https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwisweb/graph?agency_cd=USGS&site_no=02296750&parm_cd=00065&period=7">
                <br><br>
                If the water level is lower than 3.5 feet in this graph, you can hunt fossils using the
                shovel and screen method in the shallows. There are several places to
                put in and just walk; boats are not needed.<br><br>
                We have started doing our monthly hunts at Brownville Park.
                The site is 6.3 miles north of Arcadia on Brownville Rd which goes out to a
                county Park on the river. Park at the boat ramp and walk upstream to
                the island and hunt the shallows. Yes, it is free. Check the calendar for trip updates.

            <strong>Caspersen Beach Day - Feb. 29, 2022:</strong><br>
          On February 26 let’s meet at Caspersen Beach near Venice for a
          day of screening and snorkeling. I will arrive by 9AM. Bring
          along your Florida snow shovels and screens. Snorkeling the
          shallows is always fun and productive. Bring your chairs and
          coolers, drinks, and even a grill if you want to make a whole day
          of it. Caspersen Beach has showers and restrooms available.
          Keep in mind that it is difficult to predict the weather. As you all
          know, it could be 80° or 40° in February.<br><br>
          Caspersen Beach, 4100 Harbor Drive S., Venice, FL 34285<br><br>
          Get out there and hunt those rivers for fossils. Take advantage
          of the cool weather and look forward to the receding water levels
          winter will surely bring. Post your fossil finds on our Facebook page
          so we can all enjoy in your discoveries!

            <h2>Bone Valley Fossil Farm Trips:</h2><br>
            Bone Valley Fossil Farm trip dates will vary each month. The next one will be mentioned above in the updates.
            Sign up at the next club meeting or through the Facebook club page. There is a limit
            of 20 people for each trip. <strong>You must be a paid TBFC Member in good standing to attend.</strong><br>
            Meeting location and what to bring will be provided to you after you sign up. <br><br>
            <strong>What is the Bone Valley Fossil Farm?</strong><br><br>
            The Bone Valley Fossil Farm offers a unique opportunity for fossil
            hunters to hunt for Bone Valley fossils - without breaking the law.
            Bone Valley is an area in southwest Florida that is known for
            producing colorful fossil sharks teeth that have blue, green, yellow
            or cream colored enamel with white or grey roots. Most of this fossil
            layer is owned by phosphate mines and since they have stopped
            allowing fossil clubs to hunt at their mines, there is really very
            few places you could still find these types of teeth without trespassing. <br><br>
            The Bone Valley Fossil Farm fixes this issue by providing that
            fossil layer material for hunters to sift and wash through from
            8am to 2:30pm on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, or Sundays.
            Anyone can sign up to dig at the fossil farm through their
            Facebook page <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bonevalleyadventures" class="links">Bone Valley Fossil Farm</a> but the club also gets a
            chance to rent out the Farm for our TBFC Field Trip at a discounted cost per person.
            Additional details about the trip will be provided at each club meeting when possible and on the club's Facebook page.<br>

            <h1>Other Publically Accessible Peace River Hunting Locations:</h1>

            <h2>Peace River Park:</h2><br> This is where the TBFC does monthly trips, but it is open to the public too.
            <br><br>
            Peace River Park is located at 1322 Main Street East, Wauchula, FL 33873.<br><br>

            This site has a variety of hunting levels which can be seen on this
            <a class="links" href="docs/PeaceRiverPark_Labels.pdf">PDF Map</a>,
            A is deeper and for adults,
            B is very shallow and sometimes dry, C is shallow and easy to reach with a wagon if desired.

            After parking, walk across the small wooden bridge then turn sharp
            left as the path follows a small creek to the river. This is a
            primitive camping site and has no restrooms or change sites. It is
            a bit of a hike around to C but the path is mowed and easy walking.<br><br>
            You may also reach this site by kayak from the Wauchula Riverside Park Boat Ramp heading south.
            <br><br>
            The river level needs to be 7 feet or lower, as read at the <a href="#section1" class="links">Zolfo Springs</a> gauge for good/safe fossil hunting.

            <br><br>
            <h2>Brownville Park:</h2><br>
            Typically, Peace River trips were at Brownville Park but that spot
            hasn't been producing as of Fall 2022. Each season the river can expose
            new material based on the storms we've had so this could change.
            The Brownville information will remain here for those that want to try it. <br><br>
            You'll want the water level to be lower than 3.5 feet based on the <a href="#section2" class="links">Arcadia</a> gauge
            for fossil hunting in this location.
            <br><br> The GPS address is 1885 NE Brownville St.,
            Arcadia, FL, 34266. <br><br>There is a $2.00 per car fee payable in the box
            at left as you enter the gate. Bring correct change. <br>
            The park has reopened their campground and restrooms after being closed
            for a year due to COVID.

            <br><br>
            <strong>Please follow these simple rules so that we maintain our welcome at Brownville:</strong><br><br>

            - Please car pool to the park when you can. Parking is limited and
            has been a problem in the past. <br>
            - Please use the hose outside to rinse fossils. Some hunters have
            done this in the restroom sink and clogged them. <br>
            - The showers are for campers only. <br>
            - Please help keep trash picked up and haul your own trash when possible.
            <br><br>

            <h2> Thousand Trails: </h2><br>
            Folks who like to camp will enjoy Thousand Trails RV Park located at:
            <br><br>

            They border a long stretch of the Peace River.
            You must be a camper to hunt from their property. Screens and shovels
            are the recommended tools for fossil hunting from this location.
            Use the <a href="#section1" class="links">Zolfo Springs</a> guage for this location. 7ft or lower, for good hunting.
            <br><br>

            <h2> Canoe Outpost in Arcadia </h2><br>
            Rent a canoe and head up river to find gravel spots to dig and sift for fossils.
            Another location in that area is the Peace River Camp
            Ground at Arcadia, ask at the desk, when you check in and pay for a
            $15.00 pass that covers 2 days, for the wilderness area beach.

          <p> <h1>Other Publically Accessible Fossil Hunting Locations in Florida: </h1>
          <h2>Gainesville Area:</h2><br>
          If you are in the Gainesville area you can try Hog Creek, and while
          there, don't miss the Florida Museum of Natural History at the
          University, it is first rate. <br><br>
          Note: Creek Laws in Gainsville may have changed.
          Please check the local law before fossil hunting in the creeks!
          <br><br>
          <h2>Venice Beach:</h2><br>
          There are some beach spots. South of Venice at the end of Harbor Drive
          is a park called Caspersen Beach with good beach hunting
          <strong>Caspersen Beach is Closed as the access road was washed out by Hurricane Debby</strong>.
          <br><br>Englewood and north to Manasota Key is OK, but the shark teeth tend to be pretty
          worn by the waves. It is nice to sit at the waters edge and pick out
          little teeth or use a screen. If you are a certified SCUBA diver, diving from
          shore from Caspersen or Venice Beach may lead to larger teeth. There
          are also a handful of dive charters in the area that can put you on
          fossil rich spots with depths up to 30ft. If you are lucky, you may
          find a decent sized Megalodon tooth!
