            <strong>Monthly Peace River Field Trip Update:</strong><br>
            Oct. 23 - River levels are looking good!<br><br>
            <strong>Upcoming Field Trips:</strong> <br> Nov. 13 - Peace River Day Trip (earlier in the month to avoid holiday weekend)
          </div>

          <h1>Field Trips</h1>
          <p><strong>Monthly River Trips:</strong>
            Peace River trips will be at Brownville Park
            <br> The GPS address is 1885 NE Brownville St.,
            Arcadia, FL, 34266. <br>There is a $2.00 per car fee payable in the box
            at left as you enter the gate. Bring correct change. <br><br>
            The park has reopened their campground and restrooms after being closed
            for a year due to COVID. <br><br>
            I will arrive at Brownville Park around 9AM on field trip days.

            <br><br>
            I am sorry to report that we did not have a September field trip.

            Just like in years past the water is routinely too high to hunt fossils
            with summer rains. As recorded at Arcadia the river was

            nearly at 10 feet last week. The river level is posted below, as
            well as cancellations here and on the calendar when necessary.
            <br><br>
            For those folks who
            like to camp and hunt at Thousand Trails in Wauchula, I was by
            there this summer on my kayak and noted they have had sever
            bank damage and the fossil beds have been swept clean down to
            bedrock by recent floods.<br><br>

            <strong>Please follow these simple rules so that we maintain our welcome at Brownville:</strong><br><br>

            - Please car pool to the park when you can. Parking is limited and
            has been a problem in the past. <br>
            - Please use the hose outside to rinse fossils. Some hunters have
            done this in the restroom sink and clogged them. <br>
            - The showers are for campers only. <br>
            - Please help keep trash picked up and haul your own trash when possible.<br><br>
            If we are lucky, I will see you in September.
            <br><br>
            Please watch this page, the calendar and Facebook for cancellations
            due to high water. It is not unusual for TBFC to cancel river trips
            in the spring or fall due to high water levels. - FRED </p>

          <p>
            <strong>2021-2022 Season - COVID-19 Updates for Field Trip Status:</strong><br><br>
            <strong>VULCAN</strong> - All 2021 trips canceled at this time.<br>
            <strong>CEMEX BROOKSVILLE QUARRY</strong> - All 2021 trips canceled at this time.<br>
            <strong>PEACE RIVER</strong> - Fourth Saturday, water depth allowing September - May. (Check here and the Calendar for Updates) <br>
            <strong>CEMEX CENTER HILL</strong> - All 2021 trips canceled at this time.<br><br>
            Additional details can be found in the monthly club newsletter. Updates to field trips will be updated here.<br><br>

            We haven't had a TBFC quarry/mine trip since our March 2020 trip to
            the Brooksville Quarry. I absolutely thought that the mines would
            open to visitors by Fall 2021. Unfortunately, the “Delta Variant” has
            caused COVID cases to spike drastically in Florida. <br><br>
            <strong>I have been in regular contact with the Mine Plant Managers.
            The latest responses are:</strong><br><br>
            <strong>Brooksville Quarry:</strong> “There has been no change in the CEMEX
            policy. And with recent upticks in cases, I don’t foresee CEMEX
            backing off anytime soon.”<br><br>
            <strong>Star Quarry:</strong> “Unfortunately, we are still unable to allow any
            clubs at the quarry. It’s not COVID, but rather a function of our
            availability to have a supervisor with the group.” <br><br>
            <strong>Vulcan Mine:</strong> No change in the Vulcan/Cemex policy. No Field
            trips. (But they will be reviewing it.) <br><br>
            <strong>Center Hill Mine:</strong> “At this point we are limiting visitors on site.
            But I will keep in touch to let you know when we are allowing
            visitors again.”<br><br>
            I am hoping that the number of COVID cases will drop soon, and
            we can start Field Trips again later in 2021.

            If any of the mines start allowing field trips again, I will
            immediately set up some dates and post them on the Website and
            Facebook Page.<br><br>

            <strong>My recommendations for individuals this fall are:</strong><br>
            The monthly TBFC Peace River trips with Fred Hendershot
            (pending river conditions). <br>Beach trips to Casperson, Manasota,
            Venice and Nokomis. <br>Beach trip to Honeymoon Island State
            Park. <br>Trip to Yankeetown. <br>Fort Drum Crystal Mine (Rucks Pit)...
            (not my favorite). <br>Your favorite river/creek “secret honey-hole”.
            <br>Any big pile of dirt/rock on the side of the road (when your
            spouse is not with you!)<br><br>
            Good Hunting - MARLIN
          </p>
          <p> <strong>Below is general information, pre-COVID-19: </strong><br>
          Check out the Events Calender for upcoming field trip dates.
          The club has two field trips almost every month except the summer months
          when the club is closed. We go to the Vulcan limestone mine north of
          Brooksville on the second Saturday of the month to collect fossil sand
          dollars. We go to the Peace River, mostly on the fourth Saturday of the
          month, to collect shark teeth and mammal fossils.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Vulcan Field Trips:</strong><br>
          To reach Vulcan (16313 Ponce De Leon Blvd., Brooksville, FL 34613),
          take I-75 north to Exit 301, Brooksville/ Rt 98. Go ten miles to
          Brooksville and follow the signs for Rt. 98 north. Go another ten miles
          north of Brooksville on 98 and watch for the CEMEX/Vulcan signs on the
          left side. Wait by the highway entrance. We go in at 9:00 AM, so don't
          be late.

          <br><br>
          Here is some information about fossils we commonly find on our trips to
          Vulcan. (as an <a href="img/VulcanFossils.png" class="links">image</a>
          or as a <a href="docs/VulcanFossilsByRusselBrown.pdf" class="links">PDF</a>).
          <br><br>Here's some <a href="echinoids.html" class="links">info on echinoids</a> which
          are a very common find at Vulcan.
          <br><br>
          <strong>The Peace River:</strong><br>
          Open to everyone.
          Here is some information about
          <a href="fossilequipment.html" class="links">Recommended Tools</a>
          for screening in Florida rivers. Below is more information about
          locations to fossil hunt along the Peace River and other Florida
          locations.
          <br><br>

          <strong>Arcadia/Brownville:</strong><br>
          The water level for the Peace River - Arcadia Florida can be
          monitored via the US Geological Survey as seen below:<br>
          <img class="usgs-waterlevels"
            src="https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwisweb/graph?agency_cd=USGS&site_no=02296750&parm_cd=00065&period=7">
          <br><br>
          If the water level is lower than 3.5 feet in this graph, you can hunt fossils using the
          shovel and screen method in the shallows. There are several places to
          put in and just walk; boats are not needed.<br><br>
          We have started doing our monthly hunts at Brownville Park.
          The site is 6.3 miles north of Arcadia on Brownville Rd which goes out to a
          county Park on the river. Park at the boat ramp and walk upstream to
          the island and hunt the shallows. Yes, it is free. Check the calendar for trip updates.
          <br><br>
          Another location in that area is the Peace River Camp
          Ground at Arcadia, ask at the desk, when you check in and pay for a
          $15.00 pass that covers 2 days, for the wilderness area beach.
          <br><br>

          <strong>Zolfo Springs:</strong><br>
          The water level for the Peace River - Zolfo Springs Florida can be
          monitored via the US Geological Survey as seen below:<br>
          <img class="usgs-waterlevels"
            src="https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwisweb/graph?agency_cd=USGS&site_no=02295637&parm_cd=00065&period=7">
          <br><br>
          The water gage at Zolfo is in a deep hole and does not indicate
          hunting levels at Thousand Trails.
          <br> Typically, if it is 6.5 feet or lower there will be good fossil hunting in the shallows.<br><br>
          Folks who like to camp will enjoy Thousand Trails RV Park located at:
          <br>
          255 HWY 17 South, Wauchula, FL 33873
          <br><br>
          They border a long stretch of the Peace River.
          You must be a camper to hunt from their property. Screens and shovels
          are the recommended tools for fossil hunting from this location.

          <br><br>
          <strong>Gainesville Area:</strong><br>
          If you are in the Gainesville area you can try Hog Creek, and while
          there, don't miss the Florida Museum of Natural History at the
          University, it is first rate.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Venice Beach:</strong><br>
          There are some beach spots. South of Venice at the end of Harbor Drive
          is a park called Caspersen Beach with good beach hunting. Englewood
          and north to Manasota Key is OK, but the shark teeth tend to be pretty
          worn by the waves. It is nice to sit at the waters edge and pick out
          little teeth or use a screen. If you are a certified SCUBA diver, diving from
          shore from Caspersen or Venice Beach may lead to larger teeth. There
          are also a handful of dive charters in the area that can put you on
          fossil rich spots with depths up to 30ft. If you are lucky, you may
          find a Megalodon tooth!
